Chapter LXIV. The Leech.Among the higher men whom Zarathustra wishes to save, is also the
      scientific specialist—the man who honestly and scrupulously pursues
      his investigations, as Darwin did, in one department of knowledge. “I love
      him who liveth in order to know, and seeketh to know in order that the
      Superman may hereafter live. Thus seeketh he his own down-going.” “The
      spiritually conscientious one,” he is called in this discourse.
      Zarathustra steps on him unawares, and the slave of science, bleeding from
      the violence he has done to himself by his self-imposed task, speaks
      proudly of his little sphere of knowledge—his little hand’s breadth
      of ground on Zarathustra’s territory, philosophy. “Where mine honesty
      ceaseth,” says the true scientific specialist, “there am I blind and want
      also to be blind. Where I want to know, however, there want I also to be
      honest—namely, severe, rigorous, restricted, cruel, and inexorable.”
       Zarathustra greatly respecting this man, invites him too to the cave, and
      then vanishes in answer to another cry for help.
