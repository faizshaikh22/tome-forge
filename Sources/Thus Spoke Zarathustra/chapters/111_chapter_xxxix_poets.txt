Chapter XXXIX. Poets.People have sometimes said that Nietzsche had no sense of humour. I have
      no intention of defending him here against such foolish critics; I should
      only like to point out to the reader that we have him here at his best,
      poking fun at himself, and at his fellow-poets (see Note on Chapter
      LXIII., pars. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
