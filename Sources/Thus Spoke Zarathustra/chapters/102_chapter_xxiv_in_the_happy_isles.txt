Chapter XXIV. In the Happy Isles.While writing this, Nietzsche is supposed to have been thinking of the
      island of Ischia which was ultimately destroyed by an earthquake. His
      teaching here is quite clear. He was among the first thinkers of Europe to
      overcome the pessimism which godlessness generally brings in its wake. He
      points to creating as the surest salvation from the suffering which is a
      concomitant of all higher life. “What would there be to create,” he asks,
      “if there were—Gods?” His ideal, the Superman, lends him the
      cheerfulness necessary to the overcoming of that despair usually attendant
      upon godlessness and upon the apparent aimlessness of a world without a
      god.
