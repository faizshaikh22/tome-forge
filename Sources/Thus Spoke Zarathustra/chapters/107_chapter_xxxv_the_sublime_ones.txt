Chapter XXXV. The Sublime Ones.These belong to a type which Nietzsche did not altogether dislike, but
      which he would fain have rendered more subtle and plastic. It is the type
      that takes life and itself too seriously, that never surmounts the
      camel-stage mentioned in the first discourse, and that is obdurately
      sublime and earnest. To be able to smile while speaking of lofty things
      and NOT TO BE OPPRESSED by them, is the secret of real greatness. He whose
      hand trembles when it lays hold of a beautiful thing, has the quality of
      reverence, without the artist’s unembarrassed friendship with the
      beautiful. Hence the mistakes which have arisen in regard to confounding
      Nietzsche with his extreme opposites the anarchists and agitators. For
      what they dare to touch and break with the impudence and irreverence of
      the unappreciative, he seems likewise to touch and break,—but with
      other fingers—with the fingers of the loving and unembarrassed
      artist who is on good terms with the beautiful and who feels able to
      create it and to enhance it with his touch. The question of taste plays an
      important part in Nietzsche’s philosophy, and verses 9, 10 of this
      discourse exactly state Nietzsche’s ultimate views on the subject. In the
      “Spirit of Gravity”, he actually cries:—“Neither a good nor a bad
      taste, but MY taste, of which I have no longer either shame or secrecy.”
