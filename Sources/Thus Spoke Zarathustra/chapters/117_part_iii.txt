PART III.This is perhaps the most important of all the four parts. If it contained
      only “The Vision and the Enigma” and “The Old and New Tables” I should
      still be of this opinion; for in the former of these discourses we meet
      with what Nietzsche regarded as the crowning doctrine of his philosophy
      and in “The Old and New Tables” we have a valuable epitome of practically
      all his leading principles.
