Chapter LXXVII. The Awakening.In this discourse, Nietzsche wishes to give his followers a warning. He
      thinks he has so far helped them that they have become convalescent, that
      new desires are awakened in them and that new hopes are in their arms and
      legs. But he mistakes the nature of the change. True, he has helped them,
      he has given them back what they most need, i.e., belief in believing—the
      confidence in having confidence in something, but how do they use it? This
      belief in faith, if one can so express it without seeming tautological,
      has certainly been restored to them, and in the first flood of their
      enthusiasm they use it by bowing down and worshipping an ass! When writing
      this passage, Nietzsche was obviously thinking of the accusations which
      were levelled at the early Christians by their pagan contemporaries. It is
      well known that they were supposed not only to be eaters of human flesh
      but also ass-worshippers, and among the Roman graffiti, the most famous is
      the one found on the Palatino, showing a man worshipping a cross on which
      is suspended a figure with the head of an ass (see Minucius Felix,
      “Octavius” IX.; Tacitus, “Historiae” v. 3; Tertullian, “Apologia”, etc.).
      Nietzsche’s obvious moral, however, is that great scientists and thinkers,
      once they have reached the wall encircling scepticism and have thereby
      learned to recover their confidence in the act of believing, as such,
      usually manifest the change in their outlook by falling victims to the
      narrowest and most superstitious of creeds. So much for the introduction
      of the ass as an object of worship.Now, with regard to the actual service and Ass-Festival, no reader who
      happens to be acquainted with the religious history of the Middle Ages
      will fail to see the allusion here to the asinaria festa which were by no
      means uncommon in France, Germany, and elsewhere in Europe during the
      thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries.
