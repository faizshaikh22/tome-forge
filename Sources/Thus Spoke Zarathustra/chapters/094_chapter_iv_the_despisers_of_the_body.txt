Chapter IV. The Despisers of the Body.Here Zarathustra gives names to the intellect and the instincts; he calls
      the one “the little sagacity” and the latter “the big sagacity.”
       Schopenhauer’s teaching concerning the intellect is fully endorsed here.
      “An instrument of thy body is also thy little sagacity, my brother, which
      thou callest ‘spirit,’” says Zarathustra. From beginning to end it is a
      warning to those who would think too lightly of the instincts and unduly
      exalt the intellect and its derivatives: Reason and Understanding.
