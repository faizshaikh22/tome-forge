Chapter LXXV. Science.The only one to resist the “melancholy voluptuousness” of his art, is the
      spiritually conscientious one—the scientific specialist of whom we
      read in the discourse entitled “The Leech”. He takes the harp from the
      magician and cries for air, while reproving the musician in the style of
      “The Case of Wagner”. When the magician retaliates by saying that the
      spiritually conscientious one could have understood little of his song,
      the latter replies: “Thou praisest me in that thou separatest me from
      thyself.” The speech of the scientific man to his fellow higher men is
      well worth studying. By means of it, Nietzsche pays a high tribute to the
      honesty of the true specialist, while, in representing him as the only one
      who can resist the demoniacal influence of the magician’s music, he
      elevates him at a stroke, above all those present. Zarathustra and the
      spiritually conscientious one join issue at the end on the question of the
      proper place of “fear” in man’s history, and Nietzsche avails himself of
      the opportunity in order to restate his views concerning the relation of
      courage to humanity. It is precisely because courage has played the most
      important part in our development that he would not see it vanish from
      among our virtues to-day. “...courage seemeth to me the entire primitive
      history of man.”
