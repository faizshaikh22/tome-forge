Chapter LXIII. Talk with the Kings.On his way Zarathustra meets two more higher men of his time; two kings
      cross his path. They are above the average modern type; for their
      instincts tell them what real ruling is, and they despise the mockery
      which they have been taught to call “Reigning.” “We ARE NOT the first
      men,” they say, “and have nevertheless to STAND FOR them: of this
      imposture have we at last become weary and disgusted.” It is the kings who
      tell Zarathustra: “There is no sorer misfortune in all human destiny than
      when the mighty of the earth are not also the first men. There everything
      becometh false and distorted and monstrous.” The kings are also asked by
      Zarathustra to accept the shelter of his cave, whereupon he proceeds on
      his way.
