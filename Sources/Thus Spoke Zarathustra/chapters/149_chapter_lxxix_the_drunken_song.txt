Chapter LXXIX. The Drunken Song.It were the height of presumption to attempt to fix any particular
      interpretation of my own to the words of this song. With what has gone
      before, the reader, while reading it as poetry, should be able to seek and
      find his own meaning in it. The doctrine of the Eternal Recurrence appears
      for the last time here, in an art-form. Nietzsche lays stress upon the
      fact that all happiness, all delight, longs for repetitions, and just as a
      child cries “Again! Again!” to the adult who happens to be amusing him; so
      the man who sees a meaning, and a joyful meaning, in existence must also
      cry “Again!” and yet “Again!” to all his life.
