Chapter LXIX. The Shadow.Here we have a description of that courageous and wayward spirit that
      literally haunts the footsteps of every great thinker and every great
      leader; sometimes with the result that it loses all aims, all hopes, and
      all trust in a definite goal. It is the case of the bravest and most
      broad-minded men of to-day. These literally shadow the most daring
      movements in the science and art of their generation; they completely lose
      their bearings and actually find themselves, in the end, without a way, a
      goal, or a home. “On every surface have I already sat!...I become thin, I
      am almost equal to a shadow!” At last, in despair, such men do indeed cry
      out: “Nothing is true; all is permitted,” and then they become mere
      wreckage. “Too much hath become clear unto me: now nothing mattereth to me
      any more. Nothing liveth any longer that I love,—how should I still
      love myself! Have I still a goal? Where is MY home?” Zarathustra realises
      the danger threatening such a man. “Thy danger is not small, thou free
      spirit and wanderer,” he says. “Thou hast had a bad day. See that a still
      worse evening doth not overtake thee!” The danger Zarathustra refers to is
      precisely this, that even a prison may seem a blessing to such a man. At
      least the bars keep him in a place of rest; a place of confinement, at its
      worst, is real. “Beware lest in the end a narrow faith capture thee,” says
      Zarathustra, “for now everything that is narrow and fixed seduceth and
      tempteth thee.”
