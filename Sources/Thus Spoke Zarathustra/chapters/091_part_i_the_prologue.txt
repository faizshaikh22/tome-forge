PART I. THE PROLOGUE.In Part I. including the Prologue, no very great difficulties will appear.
      Zarathustra’s habit of designating a whole class of men or a whole school
      of thought by a single fitting nickname may perhaps lead to a little
      confusion at first; but, as a rule, when the general drift of his
      arguments is grasped, it requires but a slight effort of the imagination
      to discover whom he is referring to. In the ninth paragraph of the
      Prologue, for instance, it is quite obvious that “Herdsmen” in the verse
      “Herdsmen, I say, etc., etc.,” stands for all those to-day who are the
      advocates of gregariousness—of the ant-hill. And when our author
      says: “A robber shall Zarathustra be called by the herdsmen,” it is clear
      that these words may be taken almost literally from one whose ideal was
      the rearing of a higher aristocracy. Again, “the good and just,”
       throughout the book, is the expression used in referring to the
      self-righteous of modern times,—those who are quite sure that they
      know all that is to be known concerning good and evil, and are satisfied
      that the values their little world of tradition has handed down to them,
      are destined to rule mankind as long as it lasts.In the last paragraph of the Prologue, verse 7, Zarathustra gives us a
      foretaste of his teaching concerning the big and the little sagacities,
      expounded subsequently. He says he would he were as wise as his serpent;
      this desire will be found explained in the discourse entitled “The
      Despisers of the Body”, which I shall have occasion to refer to later.... THE DISCOURSES.
