Chapter XXXVII. Immaculate Perception.An important feature of Nietzsche’s interpretation of Life is disclosed in
      this discourse. As Buckle suggests in his “Influence of Women on the
      Progress of Knowledge”, the scientific spirit of the investigator is both
      helped and supplemented by the latter’s emotions and personality, and the
      divorce of all emotionalism and individual temperament from science is a
      fatal step towards sterility. Zarathustra abjures all those who would fain
      turn an IMPERSONAL eye upon nature and contemplate her phenomena with that
      pure objectivity to which the scientific idealists of to-day would so much
      like to attain. He accuses such idealists of hypocrisy and guile; he says
      they lack innocence in their desires and therefore slander all desiring.
