Chapter LXXVIII. The Ass-Festival.At length, in the middle of their feast, Zarathustra bursts in upon them
      and rebukes them soundly. But he does not do so long; in the Ass-Festival,
      it suddenly occurs to him, that he is concerned with a ceremony that may
      not be without its purpose, as something foolish but necessary—a
      recreation for wise men. He is therefore highly pleased that the higher
      men have all blossomed forth; they therefore require new festivals,—“A
      little valiant nonsense, some divine service and ass-festival, some old
      joyful Zarathustra fool, some blusterer to blow their souls bright.”He tells them not to forget that night and the ass-festival, for “such
      things only the convalescent devise! And should ye celebrate it again,” he
      concludes, “do it from love to yourselves, do it also from love to me! And
      in remembrance of ME!”
