Chapter XLII. Redemption.Zarathustra here addresses cripples. He tells them of other cripples—the
      GREAT MEN in this world who have one organ or faculty inordinately
      developed at the cost of their other faculties. This is doubtless a
      reference to a fact which is too often noticeable in the case of so many
      of the world’s giants in art, science, or religion. In verse 19 we are
      told what Nietzsche called Redemption—that is to say, the ability to
      say of all that is past: “Thus would I have it.” The in ability to say
      this, and the resentment which results therefrom, he regards as the source
      of all our feelings of revenge, and all our desires to punish—punishment
      meaning to him merely a euphemism for the word revenge, invented in order
      to still our consciences. He who can be proud of his enemies, who can be
      grateful to them for the obstacles they have put in his way; he who can
      regard his worst calamity as but the extra strain on the bow of his life,
      which is to send the arrow of his longing even further than he could have
      hoped;—this man knows no revenge, neither does he know despair, he
      truly has found redemption and can turn on the worst in his life and even
      in himself, and call it his best (see Notes on Chapter LVII.).
