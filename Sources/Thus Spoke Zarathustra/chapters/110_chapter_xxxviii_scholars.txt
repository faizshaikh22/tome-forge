Chapter XXXVIII. Scholars.This is a record of Nietzsche’s final breach with his former colleagues—the
      scholars of Germany. Already after the publication of the “Birth of
      Tragedy”, numbers of German philologists and professional philosophers had
      denounced him as one who had strayed too far from their flock, and his
      lectures at the University of Bale were deserted in consequence; but it
      was not until 1879, when he finally severed all connection with University
      work, that he may be said to have attained to the freedom and independence
      which stamp this discourse.
