Chapter XXXIV. Self-Surpassing.In this discourse we get the best exposition in the whole book of
      Nietzsche’s doctrine of the Will to Power. I go into this question
      thoroughly in the Note on Chapter LVII.Nietzsche was not an iconoclast from choice. Those who hastily class him
      with the anarchists (or the Progressivists of the last century) fail to
      understand the high esteem in which he always held both law and
      discipline. In verse 41 of this most decisive discourse he truly explains
      his position when he says: “...he who hath to be a creator in good and
      evil—verily he hath first to be a destroyer, and break values in
      pieces.” This teaching in regard to self-control is evidence enough of his
      reverence for law.
