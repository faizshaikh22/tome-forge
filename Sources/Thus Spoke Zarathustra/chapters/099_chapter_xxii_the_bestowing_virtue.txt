Chapter XXII. The Bestowing Virtue.An important aspect of Nietzsche’s philosophy is brought to light in this
      discourse. His teaching, as is well known, places the Aristotelian man of
      spirit, above all others in the natural divisions of man. The man with
      overflowing strength, both of mind and body, who must discharge this
      strength or perish, is the Nietzschean ideal. To such a man, giving from
      his overflow becomes a necessity; bestowing develops into a means of
      existence, and this is the only giving, the only charity, that Nietzsche
      recognises. In paragraph 3 of the discourse, we read Zarathustra’s healthy
      exhortation to his disciples to become independent thinkers and to find
      themselves before they learn any more from him (see Notes on Chapters
      LVI., par. 5, and LXXIII., pars. 10, 11)....
