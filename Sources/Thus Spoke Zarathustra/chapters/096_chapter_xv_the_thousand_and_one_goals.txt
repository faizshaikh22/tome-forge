Chapter XV. The Thousand and One Goals.In this discourse Zarathustra opens his exposition of the doctrine of
      relativity in morality, and declares all morality to be a mere means to
      power. Needless to say that verses 9, 10, 11, and 12 refer to the Greeks,
      the Persians, the Jews, and the Germans respectively. In the penultimate
      verse he makes known his discovery concerning the root of modern Nihilism
      and indifference,—i.e., that modern man has no goal, no aim, no
      ideals (see Note A).
