Chapter LII. The Apostates.It is clear that this applies to all those breathless and hasty “tasters
      of everything,” who plunge too rashly into the sea of independent thought
      and “heresy,” and who, having miscalculated their strength, find it
      impossible to keep their head above water. “A little older, a little
      colder,” says Nietzsche. They soon clamber back to the conventions of the
      age they intended reforming. The French then say “le diable se fait
      hermite,” but these men, as a rule, have never been devils, neither do
      they become angels; for, in order to be really good or evil, some strength
      and deep breathing is required. Those who are more interested in
      supporting orthodoxy than in being over nice concerning the kind of
      support they give it, often refer to these people as evidence in favour of
      the true faith.
