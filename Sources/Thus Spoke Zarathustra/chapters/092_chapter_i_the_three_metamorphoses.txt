Chapter I. The Three Metamorphoses.This opening discourse is a parable in which Zarathustra discloses the
      mental development of all creators of new values. It is the story of a
      life which reaches its consummation in attaining to a second ingenuousness
      or in returning to childhood. Nietzsche, the supposed anarchist, here
      plainly disclaims all relationship whatever to anarchy, for he shows us
      that only by bearing the burdens of the existing law and submitting to it
      patiently, as the camel submits to being laden, does the free spirit
      acquire that ascendancy over tradition which enables him to meet and
      master the dragon “Thou shalt,”—the dragon with the values of a
      thousand years glittering on its scales. There are two lessons in this
      discourse: first, that in order to create one must be as a little child;
      secondly, that it is only through existing law and order that one attains
      to that height from which new law and new order may be promulgated.
