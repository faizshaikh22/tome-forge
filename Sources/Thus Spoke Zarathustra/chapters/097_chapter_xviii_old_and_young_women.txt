Chapter XVIII. Old and Young Women.Nietzsche’s views on women have either to be loved at first sight or they
      become perhaps the greatest obstacle in the way of those who otherwise
      would be inclined to accept his philosophy. Women especially, of course,
      have been taught to dislike them, because it has been rumoured that his
      views are unfriendly to themselves. Now, to my mind, all this is pure
      misunderstanding and error.German philosophers, thanks to Schopenhauer, have earned rather a bad name
      for their views on women. It is almost impossible for one of them to write
      a line on the subject, however kindly he may do so, without being
      suspected of wishing to open a crusade against the fair sex. Despite the
      fact, therefore, that all Nietzsche’s views in this respect were dictated
      to him by the profoundest love; despite Zarathustra’s reservation in this
      discourse, that “with women nothing (that can be said) is impossible,” and
      in the face of other overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Nietzsche is
      universally reported to have mis son pied dans le plat, where the female
      sex is concerned. And what is the fundamental doctrine which has given
      rise to so much bitterness and aversion?—Merely this: that the sexes
      are at bottom ANTAGONISTIC—that is to say, as different as blue is
      from yellow, and that the best possible means of rearing anything
      approaching a desirable race is to preserve and to foster this profound
      hostility. What Nietzsche strives to combat and to overthrow is the modern
      democratic tendency which is slowly labouring to level all things—even
      the sexes. His quarrel is not with women—what indeed could be more
      undignified?—it is with those who would destroy the natural
      relationship between the sexes, by modifying either the one or the other
      with a view to making them more alike. The human world is just as
      dependent upon women’s powers as upon men’s. It is women’s strongest and
      most valuable instincts which help to determine who are to be the fathers
      of the next generation. By destroying these particular instincts, that is
      to say by attempting to masculinise woman, and to feminise men, we
      jeopardise the future of our people. The general democratic movement of
      modern times, in its frantic struggle to mitigate all differences, is now
      invading even the world of sex. It is against this movement that Nietzsche
      raises his voice; he would have woman become ever more woman and man
      become ever more man. Only thus, and he is undoubtedly right, can their
      combined instincts lead to the excellence of humanity. Regarded in this
      light, all his views on woman appear not only necessary but just (see Note
      on Chapter LVI., par. 21.)It is interesting to observe that the last line of the discourse, which
      has so frequently been used by women as a weapon against Nietzsche’s views
      concerning them, was suggested to Nietzsche by a woman (see “Das Leben F.
      Nietzsche’s”).
