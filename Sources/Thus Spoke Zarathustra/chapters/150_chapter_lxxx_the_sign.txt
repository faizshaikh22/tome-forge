Chapter LXXX. The Sign.In this discourse, Nietzsche disassociates himself finally from the higher
      men, and by the symbol of the lion, wishes to convey to us that he has won
      over and mastered the best and the most terrible in nature. That great
      power and tenderness are kin, was already his belief in 1875—eight
      years before he wrote this speech, and when the birds and the lion come to
      him, it is because he is the embodiment of the two qualities. All that is
      terrible and great in nature, the higher men are not yet prepared for; for
      they retreat horror-stricken into the cave when the lion springs at them;
      but Zarathustra makes not a move towards them. He was tempted to them on
      the previous day, he says, but “That hath had its time! My suffering and
      my fellow-suffering,—what matter about them! Do I then strive after
      HAPPINESS? I strive after my work! Well! the lion hath come, my children
      are nigh. Zarathustra hath grown ripe. MY day beginneth: ARISE NOW, ARISE,
      THOU GREAT NOONDAY!”...The above I know to be open to much criticism. I shall be grateful to all
      those who will be kind enough to show me where and how I have gone wrong;
      but I should like to point out that, as they stand, I have not given to
      these Notes by any means their final form.ANTHONY M. LUDOVICI.London, February 1909.
