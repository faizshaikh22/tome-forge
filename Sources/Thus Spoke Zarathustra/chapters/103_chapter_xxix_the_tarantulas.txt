Chapter XXIX. The Tarantulas.The tarantulas are the Socialists and Democrats. This discourse offers us
      an analysis of their mental attitude. Nietzsche refuses to be confounded
      with those resentful and revengeful ones who condemn society FROM BELOW,
      and whose criticism is only suppressed envy. “There are those who preach
      my doctrine of life,” he says of the Nietzschean Socialists, “and are at
      the same time preachers of equality and tarantulas” (see Notes on Chapter
      XL. and Chapter LI.).
