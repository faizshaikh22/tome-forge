Chapter XXIII. The Child with the Mirror.Nietzsche tells us here, in a poetical form, how deeply grieved he was by
      the manifold misinterpretations and misunderstandings which were becoming
      rife concerning his publications. He does not recognise himself in the
      mirror of public opinion, and recoils terrified from the distorted
      reflection of his features. In verse 20 he gives us a hint which it were
      well not to pass over too lightly; for, in the introduction to “The
      Genealogy of Morals” (written in 1887) he finds it necessary to refer to
      the matter again and with greater precision. The point is this, that a
      creator of new values meets with his surest and strongest obstacles in the
      very spirit of the language which is at his disposal. Words, like all
      other manifestations of an evolving race, are stamped with the values that
      have long been paramount in that race. Now, the original thinker who finds
      himself compelled to use the current speech of his country in order to
      impart new and hitherto untried views to his fellows, imposes a task upon
      the natural means of communication which it is totally unfitted to
      perform,—hence the obscurities and prolixities which are so
      frequently met with in the writings of original thinkers. In the “Dawn of
      Day”, Nietzsche actually cautions young writers against THE DANGER OF
      ALLOWING THEIR THOUGHTS TO BE MOULDED BY THE WORDS AT THEIR DISPOSAL.
