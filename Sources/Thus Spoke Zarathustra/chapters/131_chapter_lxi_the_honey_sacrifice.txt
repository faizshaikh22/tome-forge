Chapter LXI. The Honey Sacrifice.In the fourteenth verse of this discourse Nietzsche defines the solemn
      duty he imposed upon himself: “Become what thou art.” Surely the criticism
      which has been directed against this maxim must all fall to the ground
      when it is remembered, once and for all, that Nietzsche’s teaching was
      never intended to be other than an esoteric one. “I am a law only for mine
      own,” he says emphatically, “I am not a law for all.” It is of the
      greatest importance to humanity that its highest individuals should be
      allowed to attain to their full development; for, only by means of its
      heroes can the human race be led forward step by step to higher and yet
      higher levels. “Become what thou art” applied to all, of course, becomes a
      vicious maxim; it is to be hoped, however, that we may learn in time that
      the same action performed by a given number of men, loses its identity
      precisely that same number of times.—“Quod licet Jovi, non licet
      bovi.”At the last eight verses many readers may be tempted to laugh. In England
      we almost always laugh when a man takes himself seriously at anything save
      sport. And there is of course no reason why the reader should not be
      hilarious.—A certain greatness is requisite, both in order to be
      sublime and to have reverence for the sublime. Nietzsche earnestly
      believed that the Zarathustra-kingdom—his dynasty of a thousand
      years—would one day come; if he had not believed it so earnestly, if
      every artist in fact had not believed so earnestly in his Hazar, whether
      of ten, fifteen, a hundred, or a thousand years, we should have lost all
      our higher men; they would have become pessimists, suicides, or merchants.
      If the minor poet and philosopher has made us shy of the prophetic
      seriousness which characterized an Isaiah or a Jeremiah, it is surely our
      loss and the minor poet’s gain.
