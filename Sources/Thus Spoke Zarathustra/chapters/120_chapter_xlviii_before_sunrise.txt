Chapter XLVIII. Before Sunrise.Here we have a record of Zarathustra’s avowal of optimism, as also the
      important statement concerning “Chance” or “Accident” (verse 27). Those
      who are familiar with Nietzsche’s philosophy will not require to be told
      what an important role his doctrine of chance plays in his teaching. The
      Giant Chance has hitherto played with the puppet “man,”—this is the
      fact he cannot contemplate with equanimity. Man shall now exploit chance,
      he says again and again, and make it fall on its knees before him! (See
      verse 33 in “On the Olive-Mount”, and verses 9-10 in “The Bedwarfing
      Virtue”).
