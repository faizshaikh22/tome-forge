Chapter XLI. The Soothsayer.This refers, of course, to Schopenhauer. Nietzsche, as is well known, was
      at one time an ardent follower of Schopenhauer. He overcame Pessimism by
      discovering an object in existence; he saw the possibility of raising
      society to a higher level and preached the profoundest Optimism in
      consequence.
