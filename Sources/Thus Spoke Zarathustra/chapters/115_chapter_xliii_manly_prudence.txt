Chapter XLIII. Manly Prudence.This discourse is very important. In “Beyond Good and Evil” we hear often
      enough that the select and superior man must wear a mask, and here we find
      this injunction explained. “And he who would not languish amongst men,
      must learn to drink out of all glasses: and he who would keep clean
      amongst men, must know how to wash himself even with dirty water.” This, I
      venture to suggest, requires some explanation. At a time when
      individuality is supposed to be shown most tellingly by putting boots on
      one’s hands and gloves on one’s feet, it is somewhat refreshing to come
      across a true individualist who feels the chasm between himself and others
      so deeply, that he must perforce adapt himself to them outwardly, at
      least, in all respects, so that the inner difference should be overlooked.
      Nietzsche practically tells us here that it is not he who intentionally
      wears eccentric clothes or does eccentric things who is truly the
      individualist. The profound man, who is by nature differentiated from his
      fellows, feels this difference too keenly to call attention to it by any
      outward show. He is shamefast and bashful with those who surround him and
      wishes not to be discovered by them, just as one instinctively avoids all
      lavish display of comfort or wealth in the presence of a poor friend.
