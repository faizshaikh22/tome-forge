Chapter XXI. Voluntary Death.In regard to this discourse, I should only like to point out that
      Nietzsche had a particular aversion to the word “suicide”—self-murder.
      He disliked the evil it suggested, and in rechristening the act Voluntary
      Death, i.e., the death that comes from no other hand than one’s own, he
      was desirous of elevating it to the position it held in classical
      antiquity (see Aphorism 36 in “The Twilight of the Idols”).
