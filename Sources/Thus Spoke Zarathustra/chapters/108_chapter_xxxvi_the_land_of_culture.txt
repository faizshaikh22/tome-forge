Chapter XXXVI. The Land of Culture.This is a poetical epitome of some of the scathing criticism of scholars
      which appears in the first of the “Thoughts out of Season”—the
      polemical pamphlet (written in 1873) against David Strauss and his school.
      He reproaches his former colleagues with being sterile and shows them that
      their sterility is the result of their not believing in anything. “He who
      had to create, had always his presaging dreams and astral premonitions—and
      believed in believing!” (See Note on Chapter LXXVII.) In the last two
      verses he reveals the nature of his altruism. How far it differs from that
      of Christianity we have already read in the discourse “Neighbour-Love”,
      but here he tells us definitely the nature of his love to mankind; he
      explains why he was compelled to assail the Christian values of pity and
      excessive love of the neighbour, not only because they are slave-values
      and therefore tend to promote degeneration (see Note B.), but because he
      could only love his children’s land, the undiscovered land in a remote
      sea; because he would fain retrieve the errors of his fathers in his
      children.
