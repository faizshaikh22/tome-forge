Chapter XL. Great Events.Here we seem to have a puzzle. Zarathustra himself, while relating his
      experience with the fire-dog to his disciples, fails to get them
      interested in his narrative, and we also may be only too ready to turn
      over these pages under the impression that they are little more than a
      mere phantasy or poetical flight. Zarathustra’s interview with the
      fire-dog is, however, of great importance. In it we find Nietzsche face to
      face with the creature he most sincerely loathes—the spirit of
      revolution, and we obtain fresh hints concerning his hatred of the
      anarchist and rebel. “‘Freedom’ ye all roar most eagerly,” he says to the
      fire-dog, “but I have unlearned the belief in ‘Great Events’ when there is
      much roaring and smoke about them. Not around the inventors of new noise,
      but around the inventors of new values, doth the world revolve; INAUDIBLY
      it revolveth.”
