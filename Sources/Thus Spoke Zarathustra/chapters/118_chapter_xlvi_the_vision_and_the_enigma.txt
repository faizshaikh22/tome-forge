Chapter XLVI. The Vision and the Enigma.“The Vision and the Enigma” is perhaps an example of Nietzsche in his most
      obscure vein. We must know how persistently he inveighed against the
      oppressing and depressing influence of man’s sense of guilt and
      consciousness of sin in order fully to grasp the significance of this
      discourse. Slowly but surely, he thought the values of Christianity and
      Judaic traditions had done their work in the minds of men. What were once
      but expedients devised for the discipline of a certain portion of
      humanity, had now passed into man’s blood and had become instincts. This
      oppressive and paralysing sense of guilt and of sin is what Nietzsche
      refers to when he speaks of “the spirit of gravity.” This creature
      half-dwarf, half-mole, whom he bears with him a certain distance on his
      climb and finally defies, and whom he calls his devil and arch-enemy, is
      nothing more than the heavy millstone “guilty conscience,” together with
      the concept of sin which at present hangs round the neck of men. To rise
      above it—to soar—is the most difficult of all things to-day.
      Nietzsche is able to think cheerfully and optimistically of the
      possibility of life in this world recurring again and again, when he has
      once cast the dwarf from his shoulders, and he announces his doctrine of
      the Eternal Recurrence of all things great and small to his arch-enemy and
      in defiance of him.That there is much to be said for Nietzsche’s hypothesis of the Eternal
      Recurrence of all things great and small, nobody who has read the
      literature on the subject will doubt for an instant; but it remains a very
      daring conjecture notwithstanding and even in its ultimate effect, as a
      dogma, on the minds of men, I venture to doubt whether Nietzsche ever
      properly estimated its worth (see Note on Chapter LVII.).What follows is clear enough. Zarathustra sees a young shepherd struggling
      on the ground with a snake holding fast to the back of his throat. The
      sage, assuming that the snake must have crawled into the young man’s mouth
      while he lay sleeping, runs to his help and pulls at the loathsome reptile
      with all his might, but in vain. At last, in despair, Zarathustra appeals
      to the young man’s will. Knowing full well what a ghastly operation he is
      recommending, he nevertheless cries, “Bite! Bite! Its head off! Bite!” as
      the only possible solution of the difficulty. The young shepherd bites,
      and far away he spits the snake’s head, whereupon he rises, “No longer
      shepherd, no longer man—a transfigured being, a light-surrounded
      being, that LAUGHED! Never on earth laughed a man as he laughed!”In this parable the young shepherd is obviously the man of to-day; the
      snake that chokes him represents the stultifying and paralysing social
      values that threaten to shatter humanity, and the advice “Bite! Bite!” is
      but Nietzsche’s exasperated cry to mankind to alter their values before it
      is too late.
