Chapter LXVI. Out of Service.Zarathustra now meets the last pope, and, in a poetical form, we get
      Nietzsche’s description of the course Judaism and Christianity pursued
      before they reached their final break-up in Atheism, Agnosticism, and the
      like. The God of a strong, warlike race—the God of Israel—is a
      jealous, revengeful God. He is a power that can be pictured and endured
      only by a hardy and courageous race, a race rich enough to sacrifice and
      to lose in sacrifice. The image of this God degenerates with the people
      that appropriate it, and gradually He becomes a God of love—“soft
      and mellow,” a lower middle-class deity, who is “pitiful.” He can no
      longer be a God who requires sacrifice, for we ourselves are no longer
      rich enough for that. The tables are therefore turned upon Him; HE must
      sacrifice to us. His pity becomes so great that he actually does sacrifice
      something to us—His only begotten Son. Such a process carried to its
      logical conclusions must ultimately end in His own destruction, and thus
      we find the pope declaring that God was one day suffocated by His
      all-too-great pity. What follows is clear enough. Zarathustra recognises
      another higher man in the ex-pope and sends him too as a guest to the
      cave.
