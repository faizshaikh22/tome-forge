Chapter LXXI. The Greeting.Here I think I may claim that my contention in regard to the purpose and
      aim of the whole of Nietzsche’s philosophy (as stated at the beginning of
      my Notes on Part IV.) is completely upheld. He fought for “all who do not
      want to live, unless they learn again to HOPE—unless THEY learn
      (from him) the GREAT hope!” Zarathustra’s address to his guests shows
      clearly enough how he wished to help them: “I DO NOT TREAT MY WARRIORS
      INDULGENTLY,” he says: “how then could ye be fit for MY warfare?” He
      rebukes and spurns them, no word of love comes from his lips. Elsewhere he
      says a man should be a hard bed to his friend, thus alone can he be of use
      to him. Nietzsche would be a hard bed to higher men. He would make them
      harder; for, in order to be a law unto himself, man must possess the
      requisite hardness. “I wait for higher ones, stronger ones, more
      triumphant ones, merrier ones, for such as are built squarely in body and
      soul.” He says in par. 6 of “Higher Man”:—“Ye higher men, think ye that I am here to put right what ye have put
      wrong? Or that I wished henceforth to make snugger couches for you
      sufferers? Or show you restless, miswandering, misclimbing ones new and
      easier footpaths?”“Nay! Nay! Three times nay! Always more, always better ones of your type
      shall succumb—for ye shall always have it worse and harder.”
