340.Appearances are
          against the Historian.—It is a sufficiently
          demonstrated fact that human beings come from the womb;
          nevertheless when children grow up and stand by the side of their
          mother this hypothesis appears very absurd—all appearances are
          against it.341.The Advantage
          of Ignorance.—Some one has said that in his childhood
          he experienced such a contempt for the caprices and whims of a
          melancholy temperament that, until he had grown up and had become a
          middle-aged man, he did not know what his own temperament was like:
          it was precisely a melancholy temperament. He declared that this
          was the best of all possible kinds of ignorance.342.Do not be
          deceived!—Yes, he examined the matter from every side
          and you think him to be a[pg
          282]man of profound knowledge. But he only wishes to lower the price—he
          wants to buy it!343.A Moral
          Pretence.—You refuse to be dissatisfied with
          yourselves or to suffer from yourselves, and this you call your
          moral tendency! Very well; another may perhaps call it your
          cowardice! One thing, however, is certain, and that is that you
          will never take a trip round the world (and you yourselves are this
          world), and you will always remain in yourselves an accident and a
          clod on the face of the earth! Do you fancy that we who hold
          different views from you are merely exposing ourselves out of pure
          folly to the journey through our own deserts, swamps, and glaciers,
          and that we are voluntarily choosing grief and disgust with
          ourselves, like the Stylites?344.Subtlety in
          Mistakes.—If Homer, as they say, sometimes nodded, he
          was wiser than all the artists of sleepless ambition. We must allow
          admirers to stop for a time and take breath by letting them find
          fault now and then; for nobody can bear an uninterruptedly
          brilliant and untiring excellence—and instead of doing good such a
          master would merely become a taskmaster, whom we hate while he
          precedes us.345.Our Happiness
          is not an Argument either Pro or Con.—Many men are
          only capable[pg
          283]of a small share of happiness: and it is not an argument against
          their wisdom if this wisdom is unable to afford them a greater
          degree of happiness, any more than it is an argument against
          medical skill that many people are incurable, and others always
          ailing. May every one have the good fortune to discover the
          conception of existence which will enable him to realisehisgreatest share of happiness! though this will not necessarily
          prevent his life from being miserable and not worth envying.346.The Enemies of
          Women.—“Woman is our
          enemy”—The man who speaks to men in this way exhibits an
          unbridled lust which not only hates itself but also its means.347.The School of
          the Orator.—When a man has kept silence for a whole
          year he learns to stop chattering, and to discourse instead. The
          Pythagoreans were the best statesmen of their age.348.The Feeling of
          Power.—Note the distinction: the man who wishes to
          acquire the feeling of power seizes upon any means, and looks upon
          nothing as too petty which can foster this feeling. He who already
          possesses power, however, has grown fastidious and refined in his
          tastes; few things can be found to satisfy him.[pg 284]349.Not so very
          Important.—When we are present at a death-bed there
          regularly arises in us a thought that we immediately suppress from
          a false sense of propriety: the thought that the act of dying is
          less important than the customary veneration of it would wish us to
          believe, and that the dying man has probably lost in his life
          things which were more important than he is now about to lose by
          his death. In this case the end is certainly not the goal.350.The best way to
          Promise.—When a man makes a promise it is not merely
          the word that promises, but what lies unexpressed behind the word.
          Words indeed weaken a promise by discharging and using up a power
          which forms part of that power which promises. Therefore shake
          hands when making a promise, but put your finger on your lips—in
          this way you will make the safest promises.351.Generally
          Misunderstood.—In conversation we sometimes observe
          people endeavouring to set a trap in which to catch others—not out
          of evil-mindedness, as one might suppose, but from delight in their
          own shrewdness. Others again prepare a joke so that some one else
          may utter it, they tie the knot so that others may undo it: not[pg 285]out of goodwill, as
          might be supposed, but from wickedness, and their contempt for
          coarse intellects.352.Centre.—The feeling,“I am the centre of the world,”forcibly comes to us when we are unexpectedly overtaken by
          disgrace: we then feel as if we were standing dazed in the midst of
          a surge, and dazzled by the glance of one enormous eye which gazes
          down upon us from all sides and looks us through and through.353.Freedom of
          Speech.—“The truth must be
          told, even if the world should be shivered in fragments”—so
          cries the eminent and grandiloquent Fichte.—Yes, certainly; but we
          must have it first.—What he really means, however, is that each man
          should speak his mind, even if everything were to be turned upside
          down. This point, however, is open to dispute.354.The Courage for
          Suffering.—Such as we now are, we are capable of
          bearing a tolerable amount of displeasure, and our stomach is
          suited to such indigestible food. If we were deprived of it,
          indeed, we should perhaps think the banquet of life insipid; and if
          it were not for our willingness to suffer pain we should have to
          let too many pleasures escape us![pg 286]355.Admirers.—The man who
          admires up to the point that he would be ready to crucify any one
          who did not admire, must be reckoned among the executioners of his
          party—beware of shaking hands with him, even when he belongs to
          your own side.356.The Effect of
          Happiness.—The first effect of happiness is the
          feeling of power, and this feeling longs to manifest itself,
          whether towards ourselves or other men, or towards ideas and
          imaginary beings. Its most common modes of manifestation are making
          presents, derision, and destruction—all three being due to a common
          fundamental instinct.357.Moral
          Mosquitoes.—Those moralists who are lacking in the
          love of knowledge, and who are only acquainted with the pleasure of
          giving pain, have the spirit and tediousness of provincials. Their
          pastime, as cruel as it is lamentable, is to observe their
          neighbour with the greatest possible closeness, and, unperceived,
          to place a pin in such position that he cannot help pricking
          himself with it. Such men have preserved something of the
          wickedness of schoolboys, who cannot amuse themselves without
          hunting and torturing either the living or the dead.[pg 287]358.Reasons and
          their Unreason.—You feel a dislike for him, and
          adduce innumerable reasons for this dislike, but I only believe in
          your dislike and not in your reasons! You flatter yourself by
          adducing as a rational conclusion, both to yourself and to me, that
          which happens to be merely a matter of instinct.359.Approving of
          Something.—We approve of marriage in the first place
          because we are not yet acquainted with it, in the second place
          because we have accustomed ourselves to it, and in the third place
          because we have contracted it—that is to say, in most cases. And
          yet nothing has been proved thereby in favour of the value of
          marriage in general.360.No
          Utilitarians.—“Power which
          has greatly suffered both in deed and in thought is better than
          powerlessness which only meets with kind treatment”—such was
          the Greek way of thinking. In other words, the feeling of power was
          prized more highly by them than any mere utility or fair
          renown.361.Ugly in
          Appearance.—Moderation appears to itself to be quite
          beautiful: it is unaware of the fact that in the eyes of the
          immoderate it seems coarse and insipid, and consequently ugly.[pg 288]362.Different in
          Their Hatred.—There are men who do not begin to hate
          until they feel weak and tired: in other respects they are
          fair-minded and superior. Others only begin to hate when they see
          an opportunity for revenge: in other respects they carefully avoid
          both secret and open wrath, and overlook it whenever there is any
          occasion for it.363.Men of
          Chance.—It is pure hazard which plays the essential
          part in every invention, but most men do not meet with this
          hazard.364.Choice of
          Environment.—We should beware of living in an
          environment where we are neither able to maintain a dignified
          silence nor to express our loftier thoughts, so that only our
          complaints and needs and the whole story of our misery are left to
          be told. We thus become dissatisfied with ourselves and with our
          surroundings, and to the discomfort which brings about our
          complaints we add the vexation which we feel at always being in the
          position of grumblers. But we should, on the contrary, live in a
          place where we should be ashamed to speak of ourselves and where it
          would not be necessary to do so.—Who, however, thinks of such
          things, or of the choice in such things? We talk about our“fate,”brace up our shoulders, and
          sigh,“Unfortunate Atlas that I
          am!”[pg 289]365.Vanity.—Vanity is the
          dread of appearing to be original. Hence it is a lack of pride, but
          not necessarily a lack of originality.366.The Criminal's
          Grief.—The criminal who has been found out does not
          suffer because of the crime he has committed, but because of the
          shame and annoyance caused him either by some blunder which he has
          made or by being deprived of his habitual element; and keen
          discernment is necessary to distinguish such cases. Every one who
          has had much experience of prisons and reformatories is astonished
          at the rare instances of really genuine“remorse,”and still more so at the longing
          shown to return to the old wicked and beloved crime.367.Always
          appearing Happy.—When, in the Greece of the third
          century, philosophy had become a matter of public emulation, there
          were not a few philosophers who became happy through the thought
          that others who lived according to different principles, and
          suffered from them, could not but feel envious of their happiness.
          They thought they could refute these other people with their
          happiness better than anything else, and to achieve this object
          they were content to appear to be always happy; but, following this
          practice, they[pg
          290]were obliged to become happy in the long run! This, for example,
          was the case of the cynics.368.The Cause of
          much Misunderstanding.—The morality of increasing
          nervous force is joyful and restless; the morality of diminishing
          nervous force, towards evening, or in invalids and old people, is
          passive, calm, patient, and melancholy, and not rarely even gloomy.
          In accordance with what we may possess of one or other of these
          moralities, we do not understand that which we lack, and we often
          interpret it in others as immorality and weakness.369.Raising one's
          self above one's own Lowness.—“Proud”fellows they are indeed, those who, in
          order to establish a sense of their own dignity and importance,
          stand in need of other people whom they may tyrannise and
          oppress—those whose powerlessness and cowardice permits some one to
          make sublime and furious gestures in their presence with impunity,
          so that they require the baseness of their surroundings to raise
          themselves for one short moment above their own baseness!—For this
          purpose one man requires a dog, another a friend, a third a wife, a
          fourth a party, a fifth, again, one very rarely to be met with, a
          whole age.370.To what extent
          the Thinker loves his Enemy.—Make it a rule never to
          withhold or conceal[pg
          291]from yourself anything that may be thought against your own
          thoughts. Vow it! This is the essential requirement of honest
          thinking. You must undertake such a campaign against yourself every
          day. A victory and a conquered position are no longer your concern,
          but that of truth—and your defeat also is no longer your
          concern!371.The Evil of
          Strength.—Violence as the outcome of passion, for
          example, of rage, must be understood from the physiological point
          of view as an attempt to avoid an imminent fit of suffocation.
          Innumerable acts arising from animal spirits and vented upon others
          are simply outlets for getting rid of sudden congestion by a
          violent muscular exertion: and perhaps the entire“evil of strength”must be considered from this
          point of view. (This evil of strength wounds others
          unintentionally—it must find an outlet somewhere; while the evil of
          weakness wishes to wound and to see signs of suffering.)372.To the Credit
          of the Connoisseur.—As soon as some one who is no
          connoisseur begins to pose as a judge we should remonstrate,
          whether it is a male or female whipper-snapper. Enthusiasm or
          delight in a thing or a human being is not an argument; neither is
          repugnance or hatred.[pg 292]373.Treacherous
          Blame.—“He has no knowledge
          of men”means in the mouth of some“He does not know what baseness is”; and in the
          mouths of others,“He does not know the
          exception and knows only too well what baseness means.”374.The Value of
          Sacrifice.—The more the rights of states and princes
          are questioned as to their right to sacrifice the individual (for
          example, in the administration of justice, conscription, etc.), the
          more will the value of self-sacrifice rise.375.Speaking too
          distinctly.—There are several reasons why we
          articulate our words too distinctly: in the first place, from
          distrust of ourselves when using a new and unpractised language;
          secondly, when we distrust others on account of their stupidity or
          their slowness of comprehension. The same remark applies to
          intellectual matters: our communications are sometimes too
          distinct, too painful, because if it were otherwise those to whom
          we communicate our ideas would not understand us. Consequently the
          perfect and easy style is only permissible when addressing a
          perfect audience.376.Plenty of
          Sleep.—What can we do to arouse ourselves when we are
          weary and tired of our ego?[pg 293]Some recommend the gambling table, others
          Christianity, and others again electricity. But the best remedy, my
          dear hypochondriac, is, and always will be, plenty of sleep in both
          the literal and figurative sense of the word. Thus another morning
          will at length dawn upon us. The knack of worldly wisdom is to find
          the proper time for applying this remedy in both its forms.377.What we may
          conclude from fantastic Ideals.—Where our
          deficiencies are, there also is our enthusiasm. The enthusiastic
          principle“love your enemies”had to
          be invented by the Jews, the best haters that ever existed; and the
          finest glorifications of chastity have been written by those who in
          their youth led dissolute and licentious lives.378.Clean Hands and
          clean Walls.—Do not paint the picture either of God
          or the devil on your walls: for in so doing you will spoil your
          walls as well as your surroundings.11379.Probable and
          Improbable.—A woman secretly loved a man, raised him
          far above her, and[pg
          294]said to herself hundreds of times in her inmost heart,“If a man like that were to love me, I should look upon
          it as a condescension before which I should have to humble myself
          in the dust.”—And the man entertained the same feelings
          towards the woman, and in his inmost heart he felt the very same
          thought. When at last both their tongues were loosened, and they
          had communicated their most secret thoughts to one another, a deep
          and meditative silence ensued. Then the woman said in a cold voice:“The thing is quite clear! We are neither
          of us that which we loved! If you are what you say you are, and
          nothing more, then I have humbled myself in vain and loved you; the
          demon misled me as well as you.”This very probable story
          never happens—and why doesn't it?380.Tested
          Advice.—Of all the means of consolation there is none
          so efficacious for him who has need of it as the declaration that
          in his case no consolation can be given. This implies such a
          distinction that the afflicted person will at once raise his head
          again.381.Knowing
          one's“Individuality”.—We too often forget that
          in the eyes of strangers who see us for the first time we are quite
          different beings from what we consider ourselves to be—in most
          cases we exhibit nothing more than one particular characteristic
          which catches the eye of the stranger,[pg 295]and determines the impression we make on him.
          Thus the most peaceful and fair-minded man, if only he has a big
          moustache, may, as it were, repose in the shade of this moustache;
          for ordinary eyes will merely see in him the accessory of a big
          moustache, that is to say, a military, irascible, and occasionally
          violent character, and will act accordingly.382.Gardeners and
          Gardens.—Wet dreary days, loneliness, and unkind
          words give rise within us to conclusions like fungi; some morning
          we find that they have grown up in front of us we know not whence,
          and there they scowl at us, sullen and morose. Woe to the thinker
          who instead of being the gardener of his plants, is merely the soil
          from which they spring.383.The Comedy of
          Pity.—However much we may feel for an unhappy friend
          of ours, we always act with a certain amount of insincerity in his
          presence: we refrain from telling him everything we think, and how
          we think it, with all the circumspection of a doctor standing by
          the bedside of a patient who is seriously ill.384.Curious
          Saints.—There are pusillanimous people who have a bad
          opinion of everything that[pg 296]is best in their works, and who at the same
          time interpret and comment upon them badly: but also, by a kind of
          revenge, they entertain a bad opinion of the sympathy of others,
          and do not believe in sympathy at all; they are ashamed to appear
          to be carried away from themselves, and feel a defiant comfort in
          appearing or becoming ridiculous.—States of soul like these are to
          be found in melancholy artists.385.Vain
          People.—We are like shop-windows, where we ourselves
          are constantly arranging, concealing, or setting in the foreground
          those supposed qualities which others attribute to us—in order to
          deceiveourselves.386.Pathetic and
          Naïve.—It may be a very vulgar habit to let no
          opportunity slip of assuming a pathetic air for the sake of the
          enjoyment to be experienced in imagining the spectator striking his
          breast and feeling himself to be small and miserable. Consequently
          it may also be the indication of a noble mind to make fun of
          pathetic situations, and to behave in an undignified manner in
          them. The old, warlike nobility of France possessed that kind of
          distinction and delicacy.387.A Reflection
          before Marriage.—Supposing she loved me, what a
          burden she would be to[pg
          297]me in the long run! and supposing that she did not love me, what a
          much greater burden she would be to me in the long run! We have to
          choose between two different kinds of burdens; therefore let us
          marry.388.Rascality with
          a good Conscience.—It is exceedingly annoying to be
          cheated in small bargains in certain countries,—in the Tyrol, for
          example,—because, in addition to the bad bargain, we are compelled
          to accept the evil countenance and coarse greediness of the man who
          has cheated us, together with his bad conscience and his hostile
          feeling against us. At Venice, on the other hand, the cheater is
          highly delighted at his successful fraud, and is not in the least
          angry with the man he has cheated—nay, he is even inclined to show
          him some kindness, and above all to have a hearty laugh with him if
          he likes.—In short, one must possess wit and a good conscience in
          order to be a knave, and this will almost reconcile the cheated one
          with the cheat.12389.Rather too
          Awkward.—Good people who are too awkward to be polite
          and amiable promptly endeavour to return an act of politeness by an
          important service, or by a contribution beyond their power. It is
          touching to see them timidly producing[pg 298]their gold coins when others have offered
          them their gilded coppers!390.Hiding one's
          Intelligence.—When we surprise some one in the act of
          hiding his intelligence from us we call him evil: the more so if we
          suspect that it is his civility and benevolence which have induced
          him to do so.391.The Evil
          Moment.—Lively dispositions only lie for a moment:
          after this they have deceived themselves, and are convinced and
          honest.392.The Condition
          of Politeness.—Politeness is a very good thing, and
          really one of the four chief virtues (although the last), but in
          order that it may not result in our becoming tiresome to one
          another the person with whom I have to deal must be either one
          degree more or less polite than I—otherwise we should never get on,
          and the ointment would not only anoint us, but would cement us
          together.393.Dangerous
          Virtues.—“He forgets nothing,
          but forgives everything”—wherefore he shall be doubly
          detested, for he causes us double shame by his memory and his
          magnanimity.[pg 299]394.Without
          Vanity.—Passionate people think little of what others
          may think; their state of mind raises them above vanity.395.Contemplation.—In some
          thinkers the contemplative state peculiar to a thinker is always
          the consequence of a state of fear, in others always of desire. In
          the former, contemplation thus seems allied to the feeling of
          security, in the latter to the feeling of surfeit—in other words,
          the former are spirited in their mood, the latter over-satiated and
          neutral.
