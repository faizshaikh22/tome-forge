180.Wars.—The great wars of
          our own day are the outcome of historical study.181.Governing.—Some people
          govern because of their passion for governing; others in order that
          they may not be governed,—the latter choose it as the lesser of two
          evils.182.Rough and Ready
          Consistency.—People say of a man with great respect,“He is a character”—that is, when he
          exhibits a rough and ready consistency, when it is evident even to
          the dullest eye. But, whenever a more subtle and profound intellect
          sets itself up and shows consistency in a higher manner, the
          spectators deny the existence of any character. That is why cunning
          statesmen usually act their comedy under the cloak of a kind of
          rough and ready consistency.[pg 183]183.The Old and the
          Young.—“There is something
          immoral about Parliaments,”—so many people still
          think,—“for in them views even against the
          Government may be expressed.”—“We
          should always adopt that view of a subject which our gracious Lord
          commands,”—this is the eleventh commandment in many an
          honest old head, especially in Northern Germany. We laugh at it as
          an out-of-date fashion, but in former times it was the moral law
          itself. Perhaps we shall again some day laugh at that which is now
          considered as moral by a generation brought up under a
          parliamentary régime, namely, the policy of placing one's party
          before one's own wisdom, and of answering every question concerning
          the public welfare in such a way as to fill the sails of the party
          with a favourable gust of wind.“We must
          take that view of a subject which the position of our party calls
          for”—such would be the canon. In the service of such morals
          we may now behold every kind of sacrifice, even martyrdom and
          conquest over one's self.184.The State as a
          Production of Anarchists.—In countries inhabited by
          tractable men there are always a few backsliders and intractable
          people. For the present the latter have joined the Socialists more
          than any other party. If it should happen that these people once
          come to have the making of the laws, they may be relied upon to[pg 184]impose iron chains
          upon themselves, and to practise a dreadful discipline,—they know
          themselves! and they will endure these harsh laws with the
          knowledge that they themselves have imposed them—the feeling of
          power and of this particular power will be too recent among them
          and too attractive for them not to suffer anything for its
          sake.185.Beggars.—Beggars ought to
          be suppressed; because we get angry both when we help them and when
          we do not.186.Business
          Men.—Your business is your greatest prejudice, it
          binds you to your locality, your society and your tastes. Diligent
          in business but lazy in thought, satisfied with your paltriness and
          with the cloak of duty concealing this contentment: thus you live,
          and thus you like your children to be.187.A Possible
          Future.—Is it impossible for us to imagine a social
          state in which the criminal will publicly denounce himself and
          dictate his own punishment, in the proud feeling that he is thus
          honouring the law which he himself has made, that he is exercising
          his power, the power of a lawmaker, in thus punishing himself? He
          may offend for once, but by his own voluntary punishment he raises
          himself above his offence, and not only expiates it by his
          frankness, greatness, and calmness,[pg 185]but adds to it a public benefit.—Such would
          be the criminal of a possible future, a criminal who would, it is
          true, presuppose a future legislation based upon this fundamental
          idea:“I yield in great things as well as
          in small only to the law which I myself have made.”How many
          experiments must yet be made! How many futures have yet to dawn
          upon mankind!188.Stimulants and
          Food.—Nations are deceived so often because they are
          always looking for a deceiver,i.e.a
          stimulating wine for their senses. When they can only have this
          wine they are glad to put up even with inferior bread. Intoxication
          is to them more than nutriment—this is the bait with which they
          always let themselves be caught! What, to them, are men chosen from
          among themselves—although they may be the most expert
          specialists—as compared with the brilliant conquerors, or ancient
          and magnificent princely houses! In order that he may inspire them
          with faith, the demagogue must at least exhibit to them a prospect
          of conquest and splendour. People will always obey, and even do
          more than obey, provided that they can become intoxicated in doing
          so. We may not even offer them repose and pleasure without this
          laurel crown and its maddening influence.This vulgar
          taste which ascribes greater importance to intoxication than
          nutrition did not by any means originate in the lower ranks of the[pg 186]population: it was,
          on the contrary, transplanted there, and on this backward soil it
          grows in great abundance, whilst its real origin must be sought
          amongst the highest intellects, where it flourished for thousands
          of years. The people is the last virgin soil upon which this
          brilliant weed can grow. Well, then, is it really to the people
          that we should entrust politics in order that they may thereby have
          their daily intoxication?189.High
          Politics.—Whatever may be the influence in high
          politics of utilitarianism and the vanity of individuals and
          nations, the sharpest spur which urges them onwards is their need
          for the feeling of power—a need which rises not only in the souls
          of princes and rulers, but also gushes forth from time to time from
          inexhaustible sources in the people. The time comes again and again
          when the masses are ready to stake their lives and their fortunes,
          their consciences and their virtue, in order that they may secure
          that highest of all enjoyments and rule as a victorious,
          tyrannical, and arbitrary nation over other nations (or at all
          events think that they do).On occasions
          such as these, feelings of prodigality, sacrifice, hope,
          confidence, extraordinary audacity, and enthusiasm will burst forth
          so abundantly that a sovereign who is ambitious or far-sighted will
          be able to seize the opportunity for making war, counting upon the
          good conscience of his people to hide his injustice. Great
          conquerors[pg
          187]have always given utterance to the pathetic language of virtue;
          they have always been surrounded by crowds of people who felt
          themselves, as it were, in a state of exaltation and would listen
          to none but the most elevated oratory. The strange madness of moral
          judgments! When man experiences the sensation of power he feels and
          calls himself good; and at exactly the same time the others who
          have to endure his power call him evil!—Hesiod, in his fable of the
          epochs of man, has twice in succession depicted the same epoch,
          that of the heroes of Homer, and has thus made two epochs out of
          one: to those who lived under the terrible iron heel of those
          adventurous despots, or had heard their ancestors speak of them,
          the epoch appeared to be evil; but the descendants of those
          chivalric races worshipped it as the“good
          old times,”and as an almost ideally blissful age. The poet
          could thus not help doing what he did,—his audience probably
          included the descendants of both races.190.Former German
          Culture.—When the Germans began to interest other
          European nations, which is not so very long ago, it was owing to a
          culture which they no longer possess to-day, and which they have
          indeed shaken off with a blind ardour, as if it had been some
          disease; and yet they have not been able to replace it by anything
          better than political and national lunacy. They have in this way
          succeeded in becoming even more interesting to other nations than
          they were formerly[pg
          188]through their culture: and may that satisfy them! It is
          nevertheless undeniable that this German culture has fooled
          Europeans, and that it did not deserve the interest shown in it,
          and much less the imitation and emulation displayed by other
          nations in trying to rival it.Let us look back
          for a moment upon Schiller, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Schleiermacher,
          Hegel, and Schelling; let us read their correspondence and mingle
          for a time with the large circle of their followers: what have they
          in common, what characteristics have they, that fill us, as we are
          now, partly with a feeling of nausea and partly with pitiful and
          touching emotions? First and foremost, the passion for appearing at
          all costs to be morally exalted, and then the desire for giving
          utterance to brilliant, feeble, and inconsequential remarks,
          together with their fixed purpose of looking upon everything
          (characters, passions, times, customs) as beautiful—“beautiful,”alas, in accordance with a bad and
          vague taste, which nevertheless pretended to be of Hellenic origin.
          We behold in these people a weak, good-natured, and glistening
          idealism, which, above all, wished to exhibit noble attitudes and
          noble voices, something at once presumptuous and inoffensive, and
          animated by a cordial aversion to“cold”or“dry”reality—as also to anatomy, complete passions, and every kind of
          philosophical continence and scepticism, but especially towards the
          knowledge of nature in so far as it was impossible to use it as
          religious symbolism.Goethe, in his
          own characteristic fashion, observed from afar these movements of
          German[pg
          189]culture: placing himself beyond their influence, gently
          remonstrating, silent, more and more confirmed in his own better
          course. A little later, and Schopenhauer also was an observer of
          these movements—a great deal of the world and devilry of the world
          had again been revealed to him, and he spoke of it both roughly and
          enthusiastically, for there is a certain beauty in this devilry!
          And what was it, then, that really seduced the foreigners and
          prevented them from viewing this movement as did Goethe and
          Schopenhauer, or, better, from ignoring it altogether? It was that
          faint lustre, that inexplicable starlight which formed a mysterious
          halo around this culture. The foreigners said to themselves:“This is all very very remote from us; our
          sight, hearing, understanding, enjoyment, and powers of valuations
          are lost here, but in spite of that there may be some stars! There
          may be something in it! Is it possible that the Germans have
          quietly discovered some corner of heaven and settled there? We must
          try to come nearer to these Germans.”So they did begin to
          come nearer to the Germans, while not so very long afterwards the
          Germans put themselves to some trouble to get rid of this starlight
          halo: they knew only too well that they had not been in heaven, but
          only in a cloud!191.Better
          Men.—They tell me that our art is meant for the men
          of the present day, these greedy, unsatisfied, undisciplined,
          disgusted, and harassed spirits, and that it exhibits to them a
          picture of[pg
          190]happiness, exaltation, and unworldliness beside that of their own
          brutality, so that for once they may forget and breathe freely;
          nay, perhaps find that they may derive some encouragement towards
          flight and conversion from that oblivion. Poor artists, with such a
          public as this; half of whose thoughts require the attention of a
          priest, and the other half the attention of an alienist! How much
          happier was Corneille—“Our great
          Corneille!”as Madame de Sévigné exclaimed, with the accent
          of a woman in the presence of a whole man,—how far superior was his
          audience, which he could please with pictures of chivalric virtues,
          strict duty, generous devotion, and heroic self-denial! How
          differently did he and they love existence, not as coming from
          blind and confused“will,”which we
          curse because we cannot destroy it; but loving existence as a
          place, so to speak, where greatness joined with humanity is
          possible, and where even the greatest restraint of form, such as
          submission to the caprice of priests and princes, could not
          suppress either the pride, chivalric feeling, the grace or the
          intellect of individuals, but could, on the contrary, be felt as a
          charm and incentive, as a welcome contrast to innate
          self-glorification and distinction and the inherited power of
          volition and passion.192.The Desire for
          Perfect Opponents.—It cannot be denied that the
          French have been the most Christian nation in the world, not
          because the devotion of masses in France has been greater than[pg 191]elsewhere, but
          because those Christian ideals which are most difficult to realise
          have become incarnated here instead of merely remaining fancies,
          intentions, or imperfect beginnings. Take Pascal, for example, the
          greatest of all Christians in his combination of ardour, intellect,
          and honesty, and consider what elements had to be combined in his
          case! Take Fénelon, the most perfect and attractive embodiment of
          ecclesiastical culture in all its power: a sublime golden mean of
          whom a historian would be tempted to prove the impossibility,
          whilst in reality he was merely the perfection of something
          exceedingly difficult and improbable. Take Madame de Guyon among
          her companions, the French Quietists: and everything that the
          eloquence and ardour of the Apostle Paul has endeavoured to divine
          with regard to the Christian's state of semi-divinity, this most
          sublime, loving, silent, and ecstatic state is seen verified in
          her, without, however, that Jewish obtrusiveness that Paul showed
          towards God—due in the case of Madame de Guyon to the real old
          French artlessness in words and gestures, artlessness at once
          womanly, subtle, and distinguished. Consider, again, the founder of
          the Trappists—the last person who really took seriously the ascetic
          ideal of Christianity, not because he was an exception among
          Frenchmen, but because he was a true Frenchman: for up to our own
          day his gloomy organisation has not been able to acclimatise itself
          and to prosper, except among Frenchmen; and it has followed them
          into Alsace and Algeria.Let us not
          forget the Huguenots, either: that[pg 192]combination of a martial and industrial
          spirit, refined manners and Christian severity, has never been more
          beautifully exhibited. And it was at Port Royal that the great
          Christian erudition beheld its last era of prosperity; and in
          France more than anywhere else great men know how to prosper.
          Though not at all superficial, a great Frenchman has always his
          apparent superficiality;—he has, so to speak, a natural skin for
          his real contents and depth,—while, on the other hand, the depth of
          a great German is generally, as it were, closed up in an
          ugly-shaped box, like an elixir, which, by means of a hard and
          curious covering, endeavours to preserve itself from the light of
          day and the touch of thoughtless hands. And now let us endeavour to
          find out why a people like the French, so prolific in perfect types
          of Christians, likewise necessarily brought forth the perfect
          contrary types, those of unchristian free-thought! The French
          free-thinker, in his own inward being, had to fight against truly
          great men, and not, like the free-thinkers of other nations, merely
          against dogmas and sublime abortions.193.Espritand
          Morals.—The German, who possesses the secret of
          knowing how to be tedious in spite of wit, knowledge, and feeling,
          and who has habituated himself to consider tediousness as moral, is
          in dread in the presence of Frenchespritlest it should tear out
          the eyes of morality—but a dread mingled with“fascination,”like that experienced by the
          little bird in the presence of the rattlesnake.[pg 193]Amongst all the celebrated Germans none
          possessed moreespritthan
          Hegel, but he also had that great German dread of it which brought
          about his peculiar and defective style. For the nature of this
          style resembles a kernel, which is wrapped up so many times in an
          outer covering that it can scarcely peep through, now and then
          glancing forth bashfully and inquisitively, like“young women peeping through their veils,”to
          use the words of that old woman-hater, Æschylus. This kernel,
          however, is a witty though often impertinent joke on intellectual
          subjects, a subtle and daring combination of words, such as is
          necessary in a society of thinkers as gilding for a scientific
          pill—but, enveloped as it is in an almost impenetrable cover, it
          exhibits itself as the most abstruse science, and likewise as the
          worst possible moral tediousness. Here the Germans had a
          permissible form ofespritand they revelled in it with such boundless delight that even
          Schopenhauer's unusually fine understanding could not grasp
          it—during the whole of his life he thundered against the spectacle
          that the Germans offered to him, but he could never explain it.194.Vanity of the
          Teachers of Morals.—The relatively small success
          which teachers of morals have met with may be explained by the fact
          that they wanted too much at once,i.e.they were too ambitious and too fond of laying down precepts for
          everybody. In other words, they were beating the air and making
          speeches to animals in order to[pg 194]turn them into men; what wonder, then, that
          the animals thought this tedious! We should rather choose limited
          circles and endeavour to find and promote morals for them: for
          instance, we should make speeches to wolves with the object of
          turning them into dogs; but, above all, the greatest success will
          remain for the man who does not seek to educate either everybody or
          certain limited circles, but only one single individual, and who
          cannot be turned to the right or left from his straight purpose.
          The last century was superior to ours precisely because it
          possessed so many individually educated men, as well as educators
          in the same proportion, who had made this their life's task, and
          who with this task were dignified not only in their own eyes but in
          those of all the remaining“good
          society.”195.The so-called
          Classical Education.—Alas! we discover that our life
          is consecrated to knowledge and that we should throw it away, nay,
          that we should even have to throw it away if this consecration did
          not protect us from ourselves: we repeat this couplet, and not
          without deep emotion:Thee, Fate, I follow, though I
                fain would not,And yet I must, with many a sigh
                and groan!And then, in
          looking backwards over the course of our lives, we discover that
          there is one thing that cannot be restored to us: the wasted period
          of our youth, when our teachers did not utilise these ardent and
          eager years to lead us to the knowledge of things, but merely to
          this so-called“classical
          education”![pg
          195]Only think of this wasted youth, when we were inoculated clumsily
          and painfully with an imperfect knowledge of the Greeks and Romans
          as well as of their languages, contrary to the highest principle of
          all culture, which holds that we should not give food except to
          those who hunger for it! Think of that period of our lives when we
          had mathematics and physics forced down our throats, instead of
          being first of all made acquainted with the despair of ignorance,
          instead of having our little daily life, our activities, and
          everything occurring in our houses, our workshops, in the sky, and
          in nature, split up into thousands of problems, painful,
          humiliating and irritating problems—and thus having our curiosity
          made acquainted with the fact that we first of all require a
          mathematical and mechanical knowledge before we can be allowed to
          rejoice in the absolute logic of this knowledge! If we had only
          been imbued with reverence for those branches of science, if we had
          only been made to tremble with emotion—were it only for once—at the
          struggles, the defeats, and the renewed combats of those great men,
          of the martyrdom which is the history of pure science! But, on the
          contrary, we were allowed to develop a certain contempt for those
          sciences in favour of historical training, formal education4and“classicism.”And we allowed
          ourselves to be so easily deceived![pg 196]Formal education! Might we not have pointed
          to the best teachers at our high schools and asked laughingly,“Where then do they keep their formal
          education? and, if it is wanting in them, how can they teach
          it?”And classicism! Did we get any of that instruction
          which the ancients used to impart to their youth? Did we learn to
          speak or to write like them? Did we ceaselessly exercise ourselves
          in that duel of speech, dialectic? Did we learn to move as
          beautifully and proudly as they did, and to excel as they did in
          wrestling, throwing, and boxing? Did we learn anything of that
          practical asceticism of all the Greek philosophers? Did we receive
          any training in a single ancient virtue, and in the way in which
          the ancients were trained in it? Was not all meditation upon morals
          wanting in our education?—And how much more the only possible
          criticism on the subject of morality, those courageous and earnest
          attempts to live according to this or that morality! Did our
          teachers ever stir up a feeling in us which the ancients valued
          more highly than moderns? Did they in the spirit of the ancients
          indicate to us the divisions of the day and of life, and those aims
          by which the lives of the ancients were guided? Did we learn the
          ancient languages as we now learn the modern ones, viz. that we
          might speak them fluently and well? Nowhere can we find a real
          proficiency or any new faculty as the result of those toilsome
          years! only the knowledge of what men had learnt and were able to
          do in past ages!And what
          knowledge! Nothing becomes clearer to me year by year than the fact
          that the entire[pg
          197]Greek and ancient mode of life, however simple and evident it must
          seem to our eyes, is in truth very difficult to understand, and
          even scarcely accessible, and that the customary ease with which we
          babble about the ancients is either giddy levity or the old
          hereditary conceit of our thoughtlessness. We are deceived by words
          and ideas which appear to resemble our own, but behind them there
          is always concealed a feeling which must be strange,
          incomprehensible, or painful to our modern conceptions. And these
          are realms in which boys are allowed to roam about! Enough: we
          roamed about them in our childhood, and there we became seized with
          an almost ineradicable antipathy for all antiquity, the antipathy
          arising from an intimacy which was apparently too great! For so
          great is the conceit of our classical teachers, who would almost
          make it appear that they had gained full control over the ancients,
          that they pass on this conceit to their pupils, together with the
          suspicion that such a possession is of little use for making people
          happy, but is good enough for honest, foolish old book-worms.“Let them brood over their treasure: it is
          well worthy of them!”—It is with this unexpressed thought
          that we completed our classical education. It can't be changed
          now—for us, at all events! But let us not think of ourselves
          alone!196.The Most
          Personal Questions of Truth.—What am I really doing,
          and what do I mean by doing it? That is the question of truth which
          is not taught under our present system of education,[pg 198]and consequently not asked, because
          there is no time for it. On the other hand, we have always time and
          inclination for talking nonsense with children, rather than telling
          them the truth; for flattering women who will later on be mothers,
          rather than telling them the truth; and for speaking with young men
          about their future and their pleasures, rather than about the
          truth!But what, after
          all, are seventy years!—Time passes, and they soon come to an end;
          it matters as little to us as it does to the wave to know how and
          whither it is rolling! No, it might even be wisdom not to know
          it.“Agreed; but it shows a want of pride not even to
          inquire into the matter; our culture does not tend to make people
          proud.”“So much the better!”“Is it really?”197.Enmity of the
          Germans towards Enlightenment.—Let us consider the
          contributions which in the first half of this century the Germans
          made to general culture by their intellectual work. In the first
          place, let us take the German philosophers: they went back to the
          first and oldest stage of speculation, for they were content with
          conceptions instead of explanations, like the thinkers of dreamy
          epochs—a pre-scientific type of philosophy was thus revived by
          them. Secondly, we have the German historians and romanticists:
          their efforts on the whole aimed at restoring to the place of
          honour certain old and primitive sentiments,[pg 199]especially Christianity, the“soul of the people,”folk-lore,
          folk-speech, mediævalism, Oriental asceticism, and Hinduism. In the
          third place, there are the natural philosophers who fought against
          the spirit of Newton and Voltaire, and, like Goethe and
          Schopenhauer, endeavoured to re-establish the idea of a deified or
          diabolised nature, and of its absolute ethical and symbolical
          meaning. The main general tendency of the Germans was directed
          against enlightenment and against those social revolutions which
          were stupidly mistaken for the consequences of enlightenment: the
          piety towards everything that existed tried to become piety towards
          everything that had ever existed, only in order that heart and mind
          might be permitted to fill themselves and gush forth again, thus
          leaving no space for future and novel aims. The cult of feeling
          took the place of the cult of reason, and the German musicians, as
          the best exponents of all that is invisible, enthusiastic,
          legendary, and passionate, showed themselves more successful in
          building up the new temple than all the other artists in words and
          thoughts.If, in
          considering these details, we have taken into account the fact that
          many good things were said and investigated, and that many things
          have since then been more fairly judged than on any previous
          occasion, there yet remains to be said of the whole that it was a
          general danger, and one by no means small, to set knowledge
          altogether below feeling under the appearance of an entire and
          definitive acquaintance with the past—and, to use that expression
          of Kant, who thus defined his own particular task—“To make way again for belief by fixing the[pg 200]limits of
          knowledge.”Let us once more breathe freely, the hour of
          this danger is past! And yet, strange to say, the very spirits
          which these Germans conjured up with such eloquence have at length
          become the most dangerous for the intentions of those who did
          conjure them up: history, the comprehension of origin and
          development, sympathy with the past, the new passion for feeling
          and knowledge, after they had been for a long time at the service
          of this obscure exalted and retrograde spirit, have once more
          assumed another nature, and are now soaring with outstretched wings
          above the heads of those who once upon a time conjured them forth,
          as new and stronger genii of that very enlightenment to combat
          which they had been resuscitated. It is this enlightenment which we
          have now to carry forward,—caring nothing for the fact that there
          has been and still is“a great
          revolution,”and again a great“reaction”against it: these are but playful
          crests of foam when compared with the truly great current on which
          we float, and want to float.198.Assigning
          Prestige to one's Country.—It is the men of culture
          who determine the rank of their country, and they are characterised
          by an innumerable number of great inward experiences, which they
          have digested and can now value justly. In France and Italy this
          fell to the lot of the nobility; in Germany, where up to now the
          nobility has been, as a rule, composed of men who had not much
          intellect to boast about (perhaps this[pg 201]will soon cease to be the case), it was the
          task of the priests, the school teachers and their descendants.199.We are
          Nobler.—Fidelity, generosity, concern for one's good
          reputation: these three qualities, combined in one sentiment, we
          call noble, distinguished, aristocratic; and in this respect we
          excel the Greeks. We do not wish to give this up at any cost under
          the pretext that the ancient objects of these virtues have rightly
          fallen in esteem, but we wish cautiously to substitute new objects
          for these most precious and hereditary impulses. To understand why
          the sentiments of the noblest Greeks must be considered as inferior
          and scarcely respectable in the present age, where we are still
          under the influence of the chivalric and feudal nobility, we must
          recall the words of consolation to which Ulysses gave utterance in
          the midst of the most humiliating situations,“Bear with it, my dear heart, bear with it! Thou hast
          borne with many more swinish things5than
          these!”As an instance of this mythical example, consider
          also the tale of that Athenian officer, who, when threatened with a
          stick by another officer in the presence of the entire general
          staff, shook off his disgrace with the words,“Strike, but listen to me.”(This was
          Themistocles, that ingenious Ulysses of the classical[pg 202]epoch, who was just the man at the
          moment of disgrace to address to his“dear
          heart”that verse of comfort and affliction.)The Greeks were
          far from making light of life and death because of an insult, as
          we, influenced by a hereditary spirit of chivalric adventurousness
          and self-devotion, are in the habit of doing; or from looking for
          opportunities of honourably risking life and death, as in duels; or
          from valuing the preservation of an unstained name (honour) more
          than the acquirement of an evil reputation, when the latter was
          compatible with glory and the feeling of power; or from remaining
          faithful to the prejudices and the articles of faith of a caste,
          when these could prevent them from becoming tyrants. For this is
          the ignoble secret of the good Greek aristocrat: out of sheer
          jealousy he treats every one of the members of his caste as being
          on an equal footing with himself, but he is ready at every moment
          to spring like a tiger on his prey—despotism. What matter lies,
          murders, treason, or the betrayal of his native city to him!
          Justice was an extremely difficult matter for people of this kind
          to understand—nay, justice was almost something incredible.“The just man”was to the Greeks
          what“the saint”was to the
          Christians. When Socrates, however, laid down the axiom,“The most virtuous man is the
          happiest,”they could not trust their ears; they thought
          they had heard a madman speaking. For, as a picture of the happiest
          man, every nobleman had in his mind the cheeky audacity and devilry
          of the tyrant who sacrifices everything and every one to his own
          exuberance and pleasure. Among people whose[pg 203]imagination secretly raved about such
          happiness, the worship of the State could not, of course, have been
          too deeply implanted—but I think that men whose desire for power
          does not rage so blindly as that of the Greek noblemen no longer
          stand in need of such idolatry of the State, by means of which, in
          past ages, such a passion was kept within due bounds.200.Endurance of
          Poverty.—There is one great advantage in noble
          extraction: it makes us endure poverty better.201.The Future of
          the Nobility.—The bearing of the aristocratic classes
          shows that, in all the members of their body the consciousness of
          power is continually playing its fascinating game. Thus people of
          aristocratic habits, men or women, never sink worn out into a
          chair; when every one else makes himself comfortable, as in a
          train, for example, they avoid reclining at their ease; they do not
          appear to get tired after standing at Court for hours at a stretch;
          they do not furnish their houses in a comfortable manner, but in
          such a way as to produce the impression of something grand and
          imposing, as if they had to serve as a residence for greater and
          taller beings; they reply to a provoking speech with dignity and
          clearness of mind, and not as if scandalised, crushed, shamed, or
          out of breath in the plebeian fashion. As the aristocrat is able to
          preserve the appearance of being possessed of a[pg 204]superior physical force which never
          leaves him, he likewise wishes by his aspect of constant serenity
          and civility of disposition, even in the most trying circumstances,
          to convey the impression that his mind and soul are equal to all
          dangers and surprises. A noble culture may resemble, so far as
          passions are concerned, either a horseman who takes pleasure in
          making his proud and fiery animal trot in the Spanish fashion,—we
          have only to recollect the age of Louisxiv.,—or like the rider
          who feels his horse dart away with him like the elemental forces,
          to such a degree that both horse and rider come near losing their
          heads, but, owing to the enjoyment of the delight, do keep very
          clear heads: in both these cases this aristocratic culture breathes
          power, and if very often in its customs only the appearance of the
          feeling of power is required, nevertheless the real sense of
          superiority continues constantly to increase as the result of the
          impression which this display makes upon those who are not
          aristocrats.This
          indisputable happiness of aristocratic culture, based as it is on
          the feeling of superiority, is now beginning to rise to ever higher
          levels; for now, thanks to the free spirits, it is henceforth
          permissible and not dishonourable for people who have been born and
          reared in aristocratic circles to enter the domain of knowledge,
          where they may secure more intellectual consecrations and learn
          chivalric services even higher than those of former times, and
          where they may look up to that ideal of victorious wisdom which as
          yet no age has been able to set before itself with so good a[pg 205]conscience as the
          period which is about to dawn. Lastly, what is to be the occupation
          of the nobility in the future if it becomes more evident from day
          to day that it is less and less indecorus to take any part in
          politics?
