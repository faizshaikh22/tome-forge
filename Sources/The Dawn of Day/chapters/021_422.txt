396.Hunting.—The one is
          hunting for agreeable truths, the other for disagreeable ones. But
          even the former takes greater pleasure in the hunt than in the
          booty.397.Education.—Education is a
          continuation of procreation, and very often a kind of supplementary
          varnishing of it.398.How to
          recognise the Choleric.—Of two persons who are
          struggling together, or who love and admire one another, the more
          choleric will always be at a disadvantage. The same remark applies
          to two nations.[pg 300]399.Self-Excuse.—Many men have
          the best possible right to act in this or that way; but as soon as
          they begin to excuse their actions we no longer believe that they
          are right—and we are mistaken.400.Moral
          Pampering.—There are tender, moral natures who are
          ashamed of all their successes and feel remorse after every
          failure.401.Dangerous
          Unlearning.—We begin by unlearning to love others,
          and end by finding nothing lovable in ourselves.402.Another form of
          Toleration.—“To remain a
          minute too long on red-hot coals and to be burnt a little does no
          harm either to men or to chestnuts. The slight bitterness and
          hardness makes the kernel all the sweeter.”—Yes, this is
          your opinion, you who enjoy the taste! You sublime cannibals!403.Different
          Pride.—Women turn pale at the thought that their
          lover may not be worthy of them; Men turn pale at the thought that
          they may not[pg
          301]be worthy of the women they love. I speak of perfect women, perfect
          men. Such men, who are self-reliant and conscious of power at
          ordinary times, grow diffident and doubtful of themselves when
          under the influence of a strong passion. Such women, on the other
          hand, though always looking upon themselves as the weak and devoted
          sex, become proud and conscious of their power in the great
          exception of passion,—they ask:“Who then
          is worthy of me?”404.When we seldom
          do Justice.—Certain men are unable to feel enthusiasm
          for a great and good cause without committing a great injustice in
          some other quarter: this istheirkind of morality.405.Luxury.—The love of luxury
          is rooted in the depths of a man's heart: it shows that the
          superfluous and immoderate is the sea wherein his soul prefers to
          float.406.To
          Immortalise.—Let him who wishes to kill his opponent
          first consider whether by doing so he will not immortalise him in
          himself.407.Against our
          Character.—If the truth which we have to utter goes
          against our character—as[pg
          302]very often happens—we behave as if we had uttered a clumsy
          falsehood, and thus rouse suspicion.408.Where a great
          deal of Gentleness is Needed.—Many natures have only
          the choice of being either public evil-doers or secret
          sorrow-bearers.409.Illness.—Among illness are
          to be reckoned the premature approach of old age, ugliness, and
          pessimistic opinions—three things that always go together.410.Timid
          People.—It is the awkward and timid people who easily
          become murderers: they do not understand slight but sufficient
          means of defence or revenge, and their hatred, owing to their lack
          of intelligence and presence of mind, can conceive of no other
          expedient than destruction.411.Without
          Hatred.—You wish to bid farewell to your passion?
          Very well, but do so without hatred against it! Otherwise you have
          a second passion.—The soul of the Christian who has freed himself
          from sin is generally ruined afterwards by the hatred for sin. Just
          look at the faces of the great Christians! they are the faces of
          great haters.[pg 303]412.Ingenious and
          Narrow-Minded.—He can appreciate nothing beyond
          himself, and when he wishes to appreciate other people he must
          always begin by transforming them into himself. In this, however,
          he is ingenious.413.Private and
          Public Accusers.—Watch closely the accuser and
          inquirer,—for he reveals his true character; and it is not rare for
          this to be a worse character than that of the victim whose crime he
          is investigating. The accuser believes in all innocence that the
          opponent of a crime and criminal must be by nature of good
          character, or at least must appear as such—and this is why he lets
          himself go, that is to say, he drops his mask.414.Voluntary
          Blindness.—There is a kind of enthusiastic and
          extreme devotion to a person or a party which reveals that in our
          inmost hearts we feel ourselves superior to this person or party,
          and for this reason we feel indignant with ourselves. We blind
          ourselves, as it were, of our own free will to punish our eyes for
          having seen too much.415.Remedium
          Amoris.—That old radical remedy for love is
          now in most cases as effective as it always was: love in
          return.[pg 304]416.Where is our
          worst Enemy?—He who can look after his own affairs
          well, and knows that he can do so, is as a rule conciliatory
          towards his adversary. But to believe that we have right on our
          side, and to know that we are incapable of defending it—this gives
          rise to a fierce and implacable hatred against the opponent of our
          cause. Let every one judge accordingly where his worst enemies are
          to be sought.417.The Limits of
          all Humility.—Many men may certainly have attained
          that humility which sayscredo quia absurdum
          est, and sacrifices its reason; but, so far as I
          know, not one has attained to that humility which after all is only
          one step further, and which sayscreda quia absurdus sum.418.Acting the
          Truth.—Many a man is truthful, not because he would
          be ashamed to exhibit hypocritical feelings, but because he would
          not succeed very well in inducing others to believe in his
          hypocrisy. In a word, he has no confidence in his talent as an
          actor, and therefore prefers honestly to act the truth.419.Courage in a
          Party.—The poor sheep say to their bell-wether:“Only lead us, and we shall never[pg 305]lack courage to
          follow you.”But the poor bell-wether thinks in his heart:“Only follow me, and I shall never lack
          courage to lead you.”420.Cunning of the
          Victim.—What a sad cunning there is in the wish to
          deceive ourselves with respect to the person for whom we have
          sacrificed ourselves, when we give him an opportunity in which he
          must appear to us as we should wish him to be!421.Through
          Others.—There are men who do not wish to be seen
          except through the eyes of others: a wish which implies a great
          deal of wisdom.422.Making Others
          Happy.—Why is the fact of our making others happy
          more gratifying to us than all other pleasures?—Because in so doing
          we gratify fifty cravings at one time. Taken separately they would,
          perhaps, be very small pleasures; but when put into one hand, that
          hand will be fuller than ever before—and the heart also.
