293.Thankful.—One superfluous
          grain of gratitude and piety makes one suffer as from a vice—in
          spite of all one's independence and honesty one begins to have a
          bad conscience.294.Saints.—It is the most
          sensual men who find it necessary to avoid women and to torture
          their bodies.295.The Subtlety of
          Serving.—One of the most subtle tasks in the great
          art of serving is that of serving a more than usually ambitious
          man, who, indeed, is excessively egoistic in all things, but is
          entirely adverse to being thought so (this is part of his
          ambition). He requires that everything shall be according to his
          own will and humour, yet in such a way as to give him the
          appearance of always having sacrificed himself, and of rarely
          desiring anything for himself alone.[pg 262]296.Duelling.—I think it a
          great advantage, said some one, to be able to fight a duel—if, of
          course, it is absolutely necessary; for I have at all times brave
          companions about me. The duel is the last means of thoroughly
          honourable suicide left to us; but it is unfortunately a circuitous
          means, and not even a certain one.297.Pernicious.—A young man
          can be most surely corrupted when he is taught to value the
          like-minded more highly than the differently minded.298.Hero-Worship
          and its Fanatics.—The fanatic of an ideal that
          possesses flesh and blood is right as a rule so long as he assumes
          a negative attitude, and he is terrible in his negation: he knows
          what he denies as well as he knows himself, for the simple reason
          that he comes thence, that he feels at home there, and that he has
          always the secret fear of being forced to return there some day. He
          therefore wishes to make his return impossible by the manner of his
          negation. As soon as he begins to affirm, however, he partly shuts
          his eyes and begins to idealise (frequently merely for the sake of
          annoying those who have stayed at home). We might say that there
          was something artistic about this—agreed, but there is also
          something dishonest about it.[pg 263]The idealist of
          a person imagines this person to be so far from him that he can no
          longer see him distinctly, and then he travesties that which he can
          just perceive into something“beautiful”—that is to say, symmetrical, vaguely
          outlined, uncertain. Since he wishes to worship from afar that
          ideal which floats on high in the distance, he finds it essential
          to build a temple for the object of his worship as a protection
          from theprofanum
          vulgus. He brings into this temple for the object of
          his worship all the venerable and sanctified objects which he still
          possesses, so that his ideal may benefit by their charm, and that,
          nourished in this way, it may grow more and more divine. In the end
          he really succeeds in forming his God, but, alas for him! there is
          some one who knows how all this has been done, viz. his
          intellectual conscience; and there is also some one who, quite
          unconsciously, begins to protest against these things, viz. the
          deified one himself, who, in consequence of all this worship,
          praise, and incense, now becomes completely unbearable and shows
          himself in the most obvious and dreadful manner to be non-divine,
          and only too human.In a case like
          this there is only one means of escape left for such a fanatic; he
          patiently suffers himself and his fellows to be maltreated, and
          interprets all this miseryin maiorem dei
          gloriamby a new kind of self-deceit and noble
          falsehood. He takes up a stand against himself, and in doing so
          experiences, as an interpreter and ill-treated person, something
          like martyrdom—and in this way he climbs to the height of his
          conceit. Men of this[pg
          264]kind to be found, for example, in the entourage of Napoleon:
          indeed, perhaps it may have been he who inspired the soul of his
          century with that romantic prostration in the presence of the“genius”and the“hero,”which was so foreign to the spirit of
          rationalism of the nineteenth century—a man about whom even Byron
          was not ashamed to say that he was a“worm
          compared with such a being.”(The formulæ of this
          prostration have been discovered by Thomas Carlyle, that arrogant
          old muddle-head and grumbler, who spent his long life in trying to
          romanticise the common sense of his Englishmen: but in vain!)299.The Appearance
          of Heroism.—Throwing ourselves in the midst of our
          enemies may be a sign of cowardice.300.Condescending
          towards the Flatterer.—It is the ultimate prudence of
          insatiably ambitious men not only to conceal their contempt for man
          which the sight of flatterers causes them: but also to appear even
          condescending to them, like a God who can be nothing if not
          condescending.301.“Strength of
          Character.”—“What
          I have said once I will do”—This manner of thinking is
          believed to indicate great strength of character.[pg 265]How many actions are accomplished, not
          because they have been selected as being the most rational, but
          because at the moment when we thought of them they influenced our
          ambition and vanity by some means or another, so that we do not
          stop until we have blindly carried them out. Thus they strengthen
          in us our belief in our character and our good conscience, in short
          our strength; whilst the choice of the most rational acts possible
          brings about a certain amount of scepticism towards ourselves, and
          thus encourages a sense of weakness in us.302.Once, Twice,
          and Thrice True.—Men lie unspeakably and often, but
          they do not think about it afterwards, and generally do not believe
          in it.303.The Pastime of
          the Psychologist.—He thinks he knows me, and fancies
          himself to be subtle and important when he has any kind of
          relations with me; and I take care not to undeceive him. For in
          such a case I should suffer for it, while now he wishes me well
          because I arouse in him a feeling of conscious superiority.—There
          is another, who fears that I think I know him, and feels a sense of
          inferiority at this. As a result he behaves in a timid and
          vacillating manner, in my presence, and endeavours to mislead me in
          regard to himself so that he may regain an ascendancy over me.[pg 266]304.The Destroyers
          of the World.—When some men fail to accomplish what
          they desire to do they exclaim angrily,“May the whole world perish!”This odious
          feeling is the height of envy which reasons thus: because I cannot
          have one thing the whole world in general must have nothing! the
          whole world shall not exist!305.Greed.—When we set out to
          buy something our greed increases with the cheapness of the
          object—Why? Is it because the small differences in price make up
          the little eye of greed?306.The Greek
          Ideal.—What did the Greeks admire in Ulysses? Above
          all his capacity for lying and for taking a shrewd and dreadful
          revenge, his being equal to circumstances, his appearing to be
          nobler than the noblest when necessary, his ability to be
          everything he desired, his heroic pertinacity, having all means
          within his command, possessing genius—the genius of Ulysses is an
          object of the admiration of the gods, they smile when they think of
          it—all this is the Greek ideal! What is most remarkable about it is
          that the contradiction between seeming and being was not felt in
          any way, and that as a consequence it could not be morally
          estimated. Were there ever such accomplished actors?[pg 267]307.Facta! Yes,
          Facta Ficta!—The historian need not concern himself
          with events which have actually happened, but only those which are
          supposed to have happened; for none but the latter have produced an
          effect. The same remark applies to the imaginary heroes. His
          theme—this so-called world-history—what is it but opinions on
          imaginary actions and their imaginary motives, which in their turn
          give rise to opinions and actions the reality of which, however, is
          at once evaporated, and is only effective as vapour,—a continual
          generating and impregnating of phantoms above the dense mists of
          unfathomable reality. All historians record things which have never
          existed, except in imagination.308.Not to
          understand Trade is Noble.—To sell one's virtue only
          at the highest price, or even to carry on usury with it as a
          teacher, a civil servant, or an artist, for instance, brings genius
          and talent down to the level of the common tradesman. We must be
          careful not to be clever with our wisdom!309.Fear and
          Love.—The general knowledge of mankind has been
          furthered to a greater extent by fear than by love; for fear
          endeavours to find out who the other is, what he can do, and what
          he wants: it would be dangerous and prejudicial to[pg 268]be deceived on this point. On the other
          hand, love is induced by its secret craving to discover as many
          beautiful qualities as possible in the loved object, or to raise
          this loved object as high as possible: it is a joy and an advantage
          to love to be deceived in this way—and this is why it does it.310.Good-natured
          People.—Good-natured people have acquired their
          character from the continual fear of foreign attacks in which their
          ancestors lived,—these ancestors, who were in the habit of
          mitigating and tranquillising, humbling themselves, preventing,
          distracting, flattering, and apologising, concealing their grief
          and anger, and preserving an unruffled countenance,—and they
          ultimately bequeathed all this delicate and well-formed mechanism
          to their children and grandchildren. These latter, thanks to their
          more favourable lot, did not experience this feeling of dread, but
          they nevertheless continue in the same groove.311.The so-called
          Soul.—The sum-total of those internal movements which
          come naturally to men, and which they can consequently set in
          motion readily and gracefully, is called the soul—men are looked
          upon as void of soul when they let it be seen that their inward
          emotions are difficult and painful to them.[pg 269]312.The Forgetful
          Ones.—In outbursts of passion and the delusions of
          dreams and madness, man rediscovers his own primitive history, and
          that of humanity: animality and its savage grimaces. For once his
          memory stretches back into the past, while his civilised condition
          is developed from the forgetfulness of these primitive experiences,
          that is to say, from the failing of this memory. He who, as a
          forgetful man of a higher nature, has always remained aloof from
          these things, does not understand men—but it is an advantage if
          from time to time there are individuals who do not understand men,
          individuals who are, so to speak, created from the divine seed and
          born of reason.313.The Friend whom
          we want no Longer.—That friend whose hopes we cannot
          satisfy we should prefer to have as an enemy.314.In the Society
          of Thinkers.—In the midst of the ocean of becoming we
          adventurers and birds of passage wake up on an island no larger
          than a small boat, and here we look round us for a moment with as
          much haste and curiosity as possible; for how quickly may some gale
          blow us away or some wave sweep over the little island and leave
          nothing of us remaining! Here, however, upon this little[pg 270]piece of ground we
          meet with other birds of passage and hear of still earlier
          ones,—and thus we live together for one precious minute of
          recognition and divining, amid the cheerful fluttering of wings and
          joyful chirping, and then adventure in spirit far out on the ocean,
          feeling no less proud than the ocean itself.315.Parting with
          Something.—To give up some of our property, or to
          waive a right, gives pleasure when it denotes great wealth.
          Generosity may be placed in this category.316.Weak
          Sects.—Those sects which feel that they will always
          remain weak hunt up a few intelligent individual adherents, wishing
          to make up in quality what they lack in quantity. This gives rise
          to no little danger for intelligent minds.317.The Judgment of
          the Evening.—The man who meditates upon his day's and
          life's work when he has reached the end of his journey and feels
          weary, generally arrives at a melancholy conclusion; but this is
          not the fault of the day or his life, but of weariness.—In the
          midst of creative work we do not take time, as a rule, to meditate
          upon life and existence, nor yet in the midst of our pleasures:[pg 271]but if by a chance
          this did happen once we should no longer believe him to be right
          who waited for the seventh day and for repose to find everything
          that exists very beautiful.—He had missed the right moment.318.Beware of
          Systemisers!—There is a certain amount of comedy
          about systemisers: in trying to complete a system and to round off
          its horizon they have to try to let their weaker qualities appear
          in the same style as their stronger ones.—They wish to represent
          complete and uniformly strong natures.319.Hospitality.—The object of
          hospitality is to paralyse all hostile feeling in a stranger. When
          we cease to look upon strangers as enemies, hospitality diminishes;
          it flourishes so long as its evil presupposition does.320.The
          Weather.—An exceptional and uncertain state of the
          weather makes men suspicious even of one another: at the same time
          they come to like innovations, for they must diverge from their
          accustomed habits. This is why despots like those countries where
          the weather is moral.321.Danger in
          Innocence.—Innocent people become easy victims in all
          circumstances because[pg
          272]their lack of knowledge prevents them from distinguishing between
          moderation and excess, and from being betimes on their guard
          against themselves. It is as a result of this that innocent, that
          is, ignorant young women become accustomed to the frequent
          enjoyment of sexual intercourse, and feel the want of it very much
          in later years when their husbands fall ill or grow prematurely
          old. It is on account of this harmless and orthodox conception, as
          if frequent sexual intercourse were right and proper, that they
          come to experience a need which afterwards exposes them to the
          severest tribulations, and even worse.Considering the
          matter, however, from a higher and more general point of view,
          whoever loves a man or a thing without knowing him or it, falls a
          prey to something which he would not love if he could see it. In
          all cases where experience, precautions, and prudent steps are
          required, it is the innocent man who will be most thoroughly
          corrupted, for he has to drink with closed eyes the dregs and most
          secret poison of everything put before him. Let us consider the
          procedure of all princes, churches, sects, parties, and
          corporations: Is not the innocent man always used as the sweetest
          bait for the most dangerous and wicked traps?—just as Ulysses
          availed himself of the services of the innocent Neoptolemos to
          cheat the old and infirm anchorite and ogre of Lemnos out of his
          bow and arrows. Christianity, with its contempt for the world, has
          made ignorance a virtue—innocence, perhaps because the most
          frequent result of this innocence is precisely, as I have indicated
          above,[pg
          273]guilt, the sense of guilt, and despair: In other words, a virtue
          which leads to Heaven by the circuitous route of Hell; for only
          then can the gloomy propylæa of Christian salvation be thrown open,
          and only then is the promise of a posthumous second innocence
          effective. This is one of the finest inventions of
          Christianity!322.Living without
          a Doctor when Possible.—It seems to me that a sick
          man lives more carelessly when he is under medical observation than
          when he attends to his own health. In the first case it suffices
          for him to obey strictly all his Doctor's prescriptions; but in the
          second case he gives more attention to the ultimate object of these
          prescriptions, namely, his health; he observes much more, and
          submits himself to a more severe discipline than the directions of
          his physician would compel him to do.All rules have
          this effect: they distract our attention from the fundamental aim
          of the rule, and make us more thoughtless. But to what heights of
          immoderation and destruction would men have risen if ever they had
          completely and honestly left everything to the Godhead as to their
          physician, and acted in accordance with the words“as God will”!323.The Darkening
          of the Heavens.—Do you know the vengeance of those
          timid people who[pg
          274]behave in society just as if they had stolen their limbs? The
          vengeance of the humble, Christian-like souls who just manage to
          slink quietly through the world? The vengeance of those who always
          judge hastily, and are as hastily said to be in the wrong? The
          vengeance of all classes of drunkards, for whom the morning is
          always the most miserable part of the day? and also of all kinds of
          invalids and sick and depressed people who have no longer the
          courage to become healthy?The number of
          these petty vengeful people, and, even more, the number of their
          petty acts of revenge, is incalculable. The air around us is
          continually whizzing with the discharged arrows of their malignity,
          so that the sun and the sky of their lives become darkened
          thereby,—and, alas! not only theirs, but more often ours and other
          men's: and this is worse than the frequent wounds which they make
          on our skins and hearts. Do we not occasionally deny the existence
          of the sun and sky merely because we have not seen them for so
          long?—Well then, solitude! because of this, solitude!324.The Psychology
          of the Actor.—It is the blissful illusion of all
          great actors to imagine that the historical personages whom they
          are representing were really in the same state of mind as they
          themselves are when interpreting them—but in this they are very
          much mistaken. Their powers of imitation and divination, which they
          would fain exhibit as a clairvoyant faculty, penetrate only[pg 275]far enough to
          explain gestures, accent, and looks, and in general anything
          exterior: that is, they can grasp the shadow of the soul of a great
          hero, statesman, or warrior, or of an ambitious, jealous, or
          desperate person—they penetrate fairly near to the soul, but they
          never reach the inmost spirit of the man they are imitating.It would,
          indeed, be a fine thing to discover that instead of thinkers,
          psychologists, or experts we required nothing but clairvoyant
          actors to throw light upon the essence of any condition. Let us
          never forget, whenever such pretensions are heard, that the actor
          is nothing but an ideal ape—so much of an ape is he, indeed, that
          he is not capable of believing in the“essence”or in the“essential”: everything becomes for him merely
          performance, intonation, attitude, stage, scenery, and public.325.Living and
          Believing Apart.—The means of becoming the prophet
          and wonder-worker of one's age are the same to-day as in former
          times: one must live apart, with little knowledge, some ideas, and
          a great deal of presumption—we then finish by believing that
          mankind cannot do without us, because it is clear that we can do
          without it. When we are inspired with this belief we find faith.
          Finally, a piece of advice to him who needs it (it was given to
          Wesley by Boehler, his spiritual teacher):“Preach faith until you have it; then you will preach
          it because you have it!”[pg 276]326.Knowing our
          Circumstances.—We may estimate our powers, but not
          our power. Not only do circumstances conceal it from us and show it
          to us time about, but they even exaggerate or diminish it. We must
          consider ourselves as variable quantities whose productive capacity
          may in favourable circumstances reach the greatest possible
          heights: we must therefore reflect upon these circumstances, and
          spare no pains in studying them.327.A
          Fable.—The Don Juan of knowledge—no philosopher or
          poet has yet succeeded in discovering him. He is wanting in love
          for the things he recognises, but he possesses wit, a lust for the
          hunting after knowledge, and the intrigues in connection with it,
          and he finds enjoyment in all these, even up to the highest and
          most distant stars of knowledge—until at last there is nothing left
          for him to pursue but the absolutely injurious side of knowledge,
          just as the drunkard who ends by drinking absinthe and aquafortis.
          That is why last of all he feels a longing for hell, for this is
          the final knowledge which seduces him. Perhaps even this would
          disappoint him, as all things do which one knows! and then he would
          have to stand still for all eternity, a victim to eternal
          deception, and transformed into his enemy, the Stony Guest, who
          longs for an evening meal of knowledge which will never more fall
          to his share! for the whole world of things[pg 277]will not have another mouthful left to
          offer to these hungry men.328.What Idealistic
          Theories Disclose.—We are most certain to find
          idealistic theories among unscrupulously practical men; for such
          men stand in need of the lustre of these theories for the sake of
          their reputation. They adopt them instinctively without by any
          means feeling hypocritical in doing so—no more hypocritical than
          Englishmen with their Christianity and their Sabbath-keeping. On
          the other hand, contemplative natures who have to keep themselves
          on the guard against all kinds of fantasies and who dread to be
          reputed as enthusiasts, are only to be satisfied with hard
          realistic theories: they take possession of them under the same
          instinctive compulsion without thereby losing their honesty.329.The
          Calumniators of Cheerfulness.—People who have been
          deeply wounded by the disappointments of life look with suspicion
          upon all cheerfulness as if it were something childish and puerile,
          and revealed a lack of common sense that moves them to pity and
          tenderness, such as one would experience when seeing a dying child
          caressing his toys on his death-bed. Such men appear to see hidden
          graves under every rose; rejoicings, tumult, and cheerful music
          appear to them to be the voluntary illusions of a man who is
          dangerously ill[pg
          278]and yet wishes to take a momentary draught from the intoxicating
          cup of life. But this judgment about cheerfulness is merely the
          reflection of the latter on the dark background of weariness and
          ill-health: in itself it is something touching, irrational, and
          pitiable, even childlike and puerile, but connected with that
          second childhood which follows in the train of old age, and is the
          harbinger of death.330.Not yet
          Enough!—It is not sufficient to prove a case, we must
          also tempt or raise men to it: hence the wise man must learn to
          convey his wisdom; and often in such a manner that it may sound
          like foolishness!331.Right and
          Limits.—Asceticism is the proper mode of thinking for
          those who must extirpate their carnal instincts, because these are
          ferocious beasts,—but only for such people!332.The Bombastic
          Style.—An artist who does not wish to put his
          elevated feelings into a work and thus unburden himself, but who
          rather wishes to impart these feelings of elevation to others,
          becomes pompous, and his style becomes the bombastic style.[pg 279]333.“Humanity.”—We do not
          consider animals as moral beings. But do you think that animals
          consider us as moral beings? An animal which had the power of
          speech once said:“Humanity is a prejudice
          from which we animals at least do not suffer.”334.The Charitable
          Man.—The charitable man gratifies a need of his own
          inward feelings when doing good. The stronger this need is the less
          does such a man try to put himself in the place of those who serve
          the purpose of gratifying his desire: he becomes indelicate and
          sometimes even offensive. (This remark applies to the benevolence
          and charity of the Jews, which, as is well known, is somewhat more
          effusive than that of other peoples.)10335.That Love may
          be felt as Love.—We must be honest towards ourselves,
          and must know ourselves very well indeed, to be able to practise
          upon others that humane dissimulation known as love and
          kindness.336.What are we
          capable of?—A man who had been tormented all day by
          his wicked and malicious[pg
          280]son slew him in the evening, and then with a sigh of relief said to
          the other members of his family:“Well now
          we can sleep in peace.”Who knows what circumstances might
          drive us to!337.“Natural.”—To be natural, at
          least in his deficiencies, is perhaps the last praise that can be
          bestowed upon an artificial artist, who is in other respects
          theatrical and half genuine. Such a man will for this very reason
          boldly parade his deficiencies.338.Conscience-Substitute.—One
          man is another's conscience: and this is especially important when
          the other has none else.339.The
          Transformation of Duties.—When our duties cease to be
          difficult of accomplishment, and after long practice become changed
          into agreeable delights and needs, then the rights of others to
          whom our duties (though now our inclinations) refer change into
          something else: that is, they become the occasion of pleasant
          feelings for us. Henceforth the“other,”by virtue of his rights, becomes an
          object of love to us instead of an object of reverence and awe as
          formerly. It is our own pleasure we seek when we recognise and
          maintain the extent of his power. When the Quietists[pg 281]no longer felt their Christian faith as
          a burden, and experienced their delight only in God, they took the
          motto:“Do all to the glory of God.”Whatever they performed henceforth in this sense was no longer a
          sacrifice, it was as much as to say,“Everything for the sake of our pleasure.”To
          demand that duty should be always rather burdensome, as Kant does,
          is to demand that it shall never develop into a habit or custom.
          There is a small residue of ascetic cruelty in this demand.
