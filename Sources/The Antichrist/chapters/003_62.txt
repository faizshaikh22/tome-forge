[21]A paraphrase of Schiller’s “Against stupidity even gods
struggle in vain.”49.—I have been understood. At the opening of the Bible there is thewholepsychology of the priest.—The priest knows of only one great
danger: that is science—the sound comprehension of cause and effect.
But science flourishes, on the whole, only under favourable
conditions—a man must have time, he must have anoverflowingintellect, in order to “know.”... “Therefore, man must be made
unhappy,”—this has been, in all ages, the logic of the priest.—It iseasy to see justwhat, by this logic, was the first thing to come into
the world:—“sin.”... The concept of guilt and punishment, the whole
“moral order of the world,” was set upagainstscience—againstthe
deliverance of man from priests.... Man mustnotlook outward; he must
look inward. He mustnotlook at things shrewdly and cautiously, to
learn about them; he must not look at all; he mustsuffer.... And he
must suffer so much that he is always in need of the priest.—Away with
physicians!What is needed is a Saviour.—The concept of guilt and
punishment, including the doctrines of “grace,” of “salvation,” of
“forgiveness”—liesthrough and through, and absolutely without
psychological reality—were devised to destroy man’ssense of
causality: they are an attack upon the concept of cause and
effect!—Andnotan attack with the fist, with the knife, with honesty
in hate and love! On the contrary, one inspired by the most cowardly,
the most crafty, the most ignoble of instincts! An attack ofpriests!
An attack ofparasites! The vampirism of pale, subterranean
leeches!... When the natural consequences of an act are no longer
“natural,” but are regarded as produced by the ghostlycreations of
superstition—by “God,” by “spirits,” by “souls”—and reckoned as merely
“moral” consequences, as rewards, as punishments, as hints, as lessons,
then the whole ground-work of knowledge is destroyed—then the greatest
of crimes against humanity has been perpetrated.—I repeat that sin,
man’s self-desecrationpar excellence, was invented in order to make
science, culture, and every elevation and ennobling of man impossible;
the priestrulesthrough the invention of sin.—50.—In this place I can’t permit myself to omit a psychology of “belief,”
of the “believer,” for the special benefit of “believers.” If there
remain any today who do not yet know howindecentit is to be
“believing”—orhow much a sign ofdécadence, of a broken will to
live—then they will know it well enough tomorrow. My voice reaches even
the deaf.—It appears, unless I have been incorrectly informed, that
there prevails among Christians a sort of criterion of truth that is
called “proof by power.” “Faith makes blessed:thereforeit is
true.”—It might be objected right here that blessedness is not
demonstrated, it is merelypromised: it hangs upon “faith” as a
condition—oneshallbe blessedbecauseone believes.... But what of
the thing that the priest promises to the believer, the wholly
transcendental “beyond”—how isthatto be demonstrated?—The “proof
by power,” thus assumed, is actually no more at bottom than a belief
that the effects which faith promises will not fail to appear. In a
formula: “I believe that faith makes for blessedness—therefore, it is
true.”... But this is as far as we may go. This “therefore” would beabsurdumitself as a criterion of truth.—But let us admit, for the
sake of politeness, that blessedness by faith may be demonstrated
(—notmerely hoped for, andnotmerely promised by the suspicious
lips of a priest): even so,couldblessedness—in a technical term,pleasure—ever be a proof of truth? So little is this true that it is
almost a proof against truth when sensations of pleasure influence the
answer to the question “What is true?” or, at all events, it is enough
to make that “truth” highly suspicious. The proof by “pleasure” is a
proofof“pleasure”—nothing more; why in the world should it be
assumed thattruejudgments give more pleasure than false ones, andthat, in conformity to some pre-established harmony, they necessarily
bring agreeable feelings in their train?—The experience of all
disciplined and profound minds teachesthe contrary. Man has had to
fight for every atom of the truth, and has had to pay for it almost
everything that the heart, that human love, that human trust cling to.
Greatness of soul is needed for this business: the service of truth is
the hardest of all services.—What, then, is the meaning ofintegrityin things intellectual? It means that a man must be severe with his own
heart, that he must scorn “beautiful feelings,” and that he makes every
Yea and Nay a matter of conscience!—Faith makes blessed:therefore,
it lies....51.The fact that faith, under certain circumstances, may work for
blessedness, but that this blessedness produced by anidée fixeby no
means makes the idea itself true, and the fact that faith actually moves
no mountains, but insteadraises them upwhere there were none before:
all this is made sufficiently clear by a walk through alunatic
asylum.Not, of course, to a priest: for his instincts prompt him to
the lie that sicknessis not sickness and lunatic asylums not lunatic
asylums. Christianity finds sicknessnecessary, just as the Greek
spirit had need of a superabundance of health—the actual ulterior
purpose of the whole system of salvation of the church is tomakepeople ill. And the church itself—doesn’t it set up a Catholic lunatic
asylum as the ultimate ideal?—The whole earth as a madhouse?—The sort
of religious man that the churchwantsis a typicaldécadent; the
moment at which a religious crisis dominates a people is always marked
by epidemics of nervous disorder; the “inner world” of the religious man
is so much like the “inner world” of the overstrung and exhausted that
it is difficult to distinguish between them; the “highest” states of
mind, held up before mankind by Christianity as of supreme worth, are
actually epileptoid in form—the church has granted the name of holy
only to lunatics or to gigantic fraudsin majorem dei honorem.... Once
I ventured to designate the whole Christian system oftraining[22]in
penance and salvation (now best studied in England) as a method of
producing afolie circulaireupon a soil already prepared for it,
which is to say, a soil thoroughly unhealthy. Not every one maybe a
Christian:one is not “converted” to Christianity—one must first
be sick enough for it.... We others, who have thecouragefor healthandlikewise for contempt,—we may well despise a religion that
teaches misunderstanding of the body! that refuses to rid itself of the
superstition about the soul! that makes a “virtue” of insufficient
nourishment! that combats health as a sort of enemy, devil, temptation!
that persuades itself that it is possible to carry about a “perfect
soul” in a cadaver of a body, and that, to this end, had to devise for
itself a new concept of “perfection,” a pale, sickly, idiotically
ecstatic state of existence, so-called “holiness”—a holiness that is
itself merely a series of symptoms of an impoverished, enervated and
incurably disordered body!... The Christian movement, as a European
movement, was from the start no more than a general uprising of all
sorts of outcast and refuse elements (—who now, under cover of
Christianity, aspire to power). It doesnotrepresent the decay of a
race; it represents, on the contrary, a conglomeration ofdécadenceproducts from all directions, crowding together and seeking one another
out. It wasnot, as has been thought, the corruption of antiquity, ofnobleantiquity, which madeChristianity possible; one cannot too
sharply challenge the learned imbecility which today maintains that
theory. At the time when the sick and rotten Chandala classes in the
wholeimperiumwere Christianized, thecontrary type, the nobility,
reached its finest and ripest development. The majority became master;
democracy, with its Christian instincts,triumphed.... Christianity
was not “national,” it was not based on race—it appealed to all the
varieties of men disinherited by life, it had its allies everywhere.
Christianity has the rancour of the sick at its very core—the instinct
against thehealthy, againsthealth. Everything that is
well-constituted, proud, gallant and, above all, beautiful gives offence
to its ears and eyes. Again I remind you of Paul’s priceless saying:
“And God hath chosen theweakthings of the world, thefoolishthings of the world, thebasethings of the world, and things which
aredespised”:[23]thiswas the formula;in hoc signothedécadencetriumphed.—God on the cross—is man always to miss the
frightful inner significance of this symbol?—Everything that suffers,
everything that hangs on the cross, isdivine.... We allhang on the
cross, consequentlyweare divine.... We alone are divine....
Christianity was thus a victory: a nobler attitude of mind was destroyed
by it—Christianity remains to this day the greatest misfortune of
humanity.—[22]The wordtrainingis in English in the text.[23]1Corinthians i, 27, 28.52.Christianity also stands in opposition to allintellectualwell-being,—sick reasoning is the only sort that itcanuse as
Christian reasoning; it takes the side of everything that is idiotic; it
pronounces a curse upon “intellect,” upon thesuperbiaof the healthy
intellect. Since sickness is inherent in Christianity, it follows that
the typically Christian state of “faith”mustbe a form of sickness
too, and that all straight, straightforward and scientific paths to
knowledgemustbe banned by the church asforbiddenways. Doubt is
thus a sin from the start.... The complete lack of psychological
cleanliness in the priest—revealed by a glance at him—is a phenomenonresultingfromdécadence,—one may observe in hysterical women and
in rachitic children how regularly the falsification of instincts,
delight in lying for the mere sake of lying, and incapacity for looking
straight and walkingstraight are symptoms ofdécadence. “Faith”
means the will to avoid knowing what is true. The pietist, the priest of
either sex, is a fraudbecausehe is sick: his instinctdemandsthat
the truth shall never be allowed its rights on any point. “Whatever
makes for illness isgood; whatever issues from abundance, from
superabundance, from power, isevil”: so argues the believer. Theimpulse to lie—it is by this that I recognize every foreordained
theologian.—Another characteristic of the theologian is hisunfitness
for philology. What I here mean by philology is, in a general sense,
the art of reading with profit—the capacity for absorbing factswithoutinterpreting them falsely, andwithoutlosing caution,
patience and subtlety in the effort to understand them. Philology asephexis[24]in interpretation: whether one be dealing with books, with
newspaper reports, with the most fateful events or with weather
statistics—not to mention the “salvation of the soul.”... The way in
which a theologian, whether in Berlin or in Rome, is ready to explain,
say, a “passage of Scripture,” or an experience, or a victory bythe
national army, by turning upon it the high illumination of the Psalms of
David, is always sodaringthat it is enough to make a philologian run
up a wall. But what shall he do when pietists and other such cows from
Suabia[25]use the “finger of God” to convert their miserably
commonplace and huggermugger existence into a miracle of “grace,” a
“providence” and an “experience of salvation”? The most modest exercise
of the intellect, not to say of decency, should certainly be enough to
convince these interpreters of the perfect childishness and unworthiness
of such a misuse of the divine digital dexterity. However small our
piety, if we ever encountered a god who always cured us of a cold in the
head at just the right time, or got us into our carriage at the very
instant heavy rain began to fall, he would seem so absurd a god that
he’d have to be abolished even if he existed. God as a domestic servant,
as a letter carrier, as an almanac-man—at bottom, he is a mere name for
the stupidest sort of chance.... “Divine Providence,” which every third
man in “educated Germany” still believes in, is so strong an argument
against God that it would be impossible to think of a stronger. And in
any case it is an argument against Germans!...[24]That is, to say, scepticism. Among the Greeks scepticism
was also occasionally called ephecticism.[25]A reference to the University of Tübingen and its famous
school of Biblical criticism. The leader of this school was F. C. Baur,
and one of the men greatly influenced by it was Nietzsche’s pet
abomination, David F. Strauss, himself a Suabian.Vide§ 10 and § 28.53.—It is so little true thatmartyrsoffer any support to the truth of
a cause that I am inclined to deny that any martyr has ever had anything
to do with the truth at all. In the very tone in which a martyr flings
what he fancies to be true at the head of the world there appears so low
a grade of intellectual honesty and suchinsensibilityto the problem
of “truth,” that it is never necessary to refute him. Truth is not
something that one man has and another man has not: at best, only
peasants, or peasant-apostles like Luther, can think of truth in any
such way. One may rest assured that the greater the degree of a man’s
intellectual conscience the greater will be his modesty, hisdiscretion, on this point. Toknowin five cases, and to refuse,
with delicacy, to know anythingfurther.... “Truth,” as the word is
understood by every prophet, every sectarian, every free-thinker, every
Socialist and every churchman, is simply a complete proofthat not even
a beginning has been made in the intellectual discipline and
self-control that are necessary to the unearthing of even the smallest
truth.—The deaths of the martyrs, it may be said in passing, have been
misfortunes of history: they havemisled.... The conclusion that all
idiots, women and plebeians come to, that there must be something in a
cause for which any one goes to his death (or which, as under primitive
Christianity, sets off epidemics of death-seeking)—this conclusion has
been an unspeakable drag upon the testing of facts, upon the whole
spirit of inquiry and investigation. The martyrs havedamagedthe
truth.... Even to this day the crude fact of persecution is enough to
give an honourable name to the most empty sort of sectarianism.—But
why? Is the worth of a cause altered by the fact that some one had laid
down his life for it?—An error that becomes honourable is simply an
error that has acquired one seductive charm the more: do you suppose,
Messrs. Theologians, that we shall give you the chance to be martyred
for your lies?—One best disposes of a cause by respectfully putting it
on ice—that is also the best way to dispose of theologians.... This was
precisely the world-historical stupidity of all the persecutors: that
they gave the appearance of honour to the cause they opposed—that they
made it a present of the fascination of martyrdom.... Women are still on
their knees before an error because they have been told that some one
died on the cross for it.Is the cross, then, an argument?—But about
all these things there is one, and one only, who has said what has been
needed for thousands of years—Zarathustra.They made signs in blood along the way that they went, and their folly
taught them that the truth is proved by blood.But blood is the worst of all testimonies to the truth; blood poisoneth
even the purest teaching and turneth it into madness and hatred in the
heart.And when one goeth through fire for his teaching—what doth that prove?
Verily, it is more when one’s teaching cometh out of one’s own
burning![26][26]The quotations are from “Also sprach Zarathustra” ii, 24:
“Of Priests.”54.Do not let yourself be deceived: great intellects are sceptical.
Zarathustra is a sceptic. The strength, thefreedomwhich proceed from
intellectual power, from a superabundance of intellectual power,manifestthemselves as scepticism. Men of fixed convictions do not
count when it comes to determining what is fundamental in values and
lack of values. Men of convictions are prisoners. They do not see far
enough, they do not see what isbelowthem: whereas a man who would
talk to any purpose about value and non-value must be able to see five
hundred convictionsbeneathhim—andbehindhim.... A mind that
aspires to great things, and that wills the means thereto, is
necessarily sceptical. Freedom from any sort of convictionbelongsto
strength, and to an independent point of view.... That grand passion
which is at once the foundation and the power of a sceptic’s existence,
and is both more enlightened and more despotic than he is himself,
drafts the whole of his intellect into its service; it makes him
unscrupulous; it gives him courage to employ unholy means; under certain
circumstances it does notbegrudgehim even convictions. Conviction as
a means: one may achieve a good deal by means of a conviction. A grand
passion makes use of and uses up convictions; it does not yield to
them—it knows itself to be sovereign.—On the contrary, the need of
faith, of something unconditioned by yea or nay, of Carlylism,if I may
be allowed the word, is a need ofweakness. The man of faith, the
“believer” of any sort, is necessarily a dependent man—such a man
cannot posithimselfas a goal, nor can he find goals within himself.
The “believer” does not belong to himself; he can only be a means to an
end; he must beused up; he needs some one to use him up. His instinct
gives the highest honours to an ethic of self-effacement; he is prompted
to embrace it by everything: his prudence, his experience, his vanity.
Every sort of faith is in itself an evidence of self-effacement, of
self-estrangement.... When one reflects how necessary it is to the great
majority that there be regulations to restrain them from without and
hold them fast, and to what extent control, or, in a higher sense,slavery, is the one and only condition which makes for the well-being
of the weak-willed man, and especially woman, then one at once
understands conviction and “faith.” To the man with convictions they are
his backbone. Toavoidseeing many things, to be impartial about
nothing, to be a party man through and through, to estimate all values
strictly and infallibly—these are conditions necessary to the existence
of such a man.But by the same token they areantagonistsof the
truthful man—of the truth.... The believer is not free to answer the
question, “true” or “not true,” according to the dictates of his own
conscience: integrity onthispoint would work his instant downfall.
The pathological limitations of his vision turn the man of convictions
into a fanatic—Savonarola, Luther, Rousseau, Robespierre,
Saint-Simon—these types stand in opposition to the strong,emancipatedspirit. But the grandiose attitudes of thesesickintellects, these intellectual epileptics, are of influence upon the
great masses—fanatics are picturesque, and mankind prefers observing
poses to listening toreasons....55.—One step further in the psychology of conviction, of “faith.” It is
now a good while since I first proposed for consideration the question
whether convictions are not even more dangerous enemies to truth than
lies. (“Human, All-Too-Human,” I, aphorism 483.)[27]This time I desire
to put the question definitely: is thereany actual difference between
a lie and a conviction?—All the world believes that there is; but what
is not believed by all the world!—Every conviction has its history, its
primitive forms, its stage of tentativeness and error: itbecomesa
conviction only after having been, for a long time,notone, and then,
for an even longer time,hardlyone. What if falsehood be also one of
these embryonic forms of conviction?—Sometimes all that is needed is a
change in persons: what was a lie in the father becomes a conviction in
the son.—I call it lying to refuse to see what one sees, or to refuse
to see itasit is: whether the lie be uttered before witnesses or not
before witnesses is of no consequence. The most common sort of lie is
that by which a man deceives himself: the deception of others is a
relatively rare offence.—Now, this willnotto see what one sees,
this willnotto see it as it is, is almost the first requisite for
all who belong to a party of whatever sort: the party man becomes
inevitably a liar. For example, the German historians are convinced that
Rome was synonymous with despotism and that the Germanic peoples brought
the spirit of liberty into the world: what is the difference between
this conviction and alie? Is it to be wondered at that all partisans,
including the German historians, instinctively roll the fine phrases of
morality upon their tongues—that morality almost owes its verysurvivalto the fact that the party man of every sort has need of it
every moment?—“This isourconviction: we publish it to the whole
world; we live and die for it—let us respect all who have
convictions!”—I have actually heard such sentiments from the mouths of
anti-Semites. On the contrary, gentlemen! An anti-Semite surely does not
become more respectable because he lies on principle.... The priests,
who have more finesse in such matters, and who well understand the
objection that lies against the notion of a conviction, which is to say,
of a falsehood that becomes a matter of principlebecauseit serves a
purpose, have borrowed from the Jews the shrewd device of sneaking in
the concepts, “God,” “the will of God” and “the revelation of God” at
this place. Kant, too, with his categorical imperative, was on the same
road: this was hispracticalreason.[28]There are questions regarding
the truth or untruth of which it isnotfor man to decide; all the
capital questions, all the capital problems of valuation, are beyond
human reason.... To know the limits of reason—thatalone is genuine
philosophy.... Why did God make a revelation to man? Would God have done
anything superfluous? Mancouldnot find out for himself what was good
and what was evil, so God taught him His will.... Moral: the priest doesnotlie—the question, “true” or “untrue,” has nothing to do with such
things as the priest discusses; it is impossible to lie about these
things. In order to lie here it would be necessary to knowwhatis
true. But this is more than mancanknow; therefore, the priest is
simply themouthpieceof God.—Such a priestly syllogism
is by no means merely Jewish and Christian; the right to lie and theshrewd dodgeof “revelation” belong to the general priestly type—to
the priest of thedécadenceas well as to the priest of pagan times
(—Pagans are all those who say yes to life, and to whom “God” is a word
signifying acquiescence in all things).—The “law,” the “will of God,”
the “holy book,” and “inspiration”—all these things are merely words
for the conditionsunderwhich the priest comes to power andwithwhich hemaintains his power,—these concepts are to be found at the
bottom of all priestly organizations, and of all priestly or
priestly-philosophical schemes of governments. The “holy lie”—common
alike to Confucius, to the Code of Manu, to Mohammed and to the
Christian church—is not even wanting in Plato. “Truth is here”: this
means, no matter where it is heard,the priest lies....[27]The aphorism, which is headed “The Enemies of Truth,”
makes the direct statement: “Convictions are more dangerous enemies of
truth than lies.”[28]A reference, of course, to Kant’s “Kritik der praktischen
Vernunft” (Critique of Practical Reason).56.—In the last analysis it comes to this: what is theendof lying? The
fact that, in Christianity, “holy” ends are not visible ismyobjection to the means it employs. Onlybadends appear: the
poisoning, the calumniation, the denial of life, the despising of the
body, the degradation and self-contamination of man by the concept of
sin—therefore, its means are also bad.—I have a contrary feeling
when I read the Code of Manu, an incomparably more intellectual and
superior work, which it would be a sin against theintelligenceto so
much asnamein the same breath with the Bible. It is easy to see why:
there is a genuine philosophy behind it,init, not merely an
evil-smelling mess of Jewish rabbinism andsuperstition,—it gives even
the most fastidious psychologist something to sink his teeth into. And,notto forget what is most important, it differs fundamentally from
every kind of Bible: by means of it thenobles, the philosophers and
the warriors keep the whip-hand over the majority; it is full of noble
valuations, it shows a feeling of perfection, an acceptance of life, and
triumphant feeling toward self and life—thesunshines upon the whole
book.—All the things on which Christianity vents its fathomless
vulgarity—for example, procreation, women and marriage—are here
handled earnestly, with reverence and with love and confidence. How can
any one really put into the hands of children and ladies a book which
contains such vile things as this: “to avoid fornication, let every man
have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband; ... it is
better to marry than to burn”?[29]And is itpossibleto be a
Christian so long as the origin of man is Christianized, which is to
say,befouled, by the doctrine of theimmaculata conceptio?... I
know of no book in which so many delicate and kindly things are said of
women as in the Code of Manu; these oldgrey-beards and saints have a
way of being gallant to women that it would be impossible, perhaps, to
surpass. “The mouth of a woman,” it says in one place, “the breasts of a
maiden, the prayer of a child and the smoke of sacrifice are always
pure.” In another place: “there is nothing purer than the light of the
sun, the shadow cast by a cow, air, water, fire and the breath of a
maiden.” Finally, in still another place—perhaps this is also a holy
lie—: “all the orifices of the body above the navel are pure, and all
below are impure. Only in the maiden is the whole body pure.”[29]1Corinthians vii, 2, 9.57.One catches theunholinessof Christian meansin flagrantiby the
simple process of putting the ends sought by Christianity beside the
ends sought by the Code of Manu—by putting these enormously
antithetical ends under a strong light. The critic of Christianity
cannot evade the necessity of making Christianitycontemptible.—A
book of laws such as the Code of Manu has the same origin as every other
good law-book: it epitomizes the experience, the sagacity and the
ethical experimentation of long centuries; it bringsthings to a
conclusion; it no longer creates. The prerequisite to a codification of
this sort is recognition of the fact that the means which establish the
authority of a slowly and painfully attainedtruthare fundamentally
different from those which one would make use of to prove it. A law-book
never recites the utility, the grounds, the casuistical antecedents of a
law: for if it did so it would lose the imperative tone, the “thou
shall,” on which obedience is based. The problem lies exactly here.—At
a certain point in the evolution of a people, the class within it of the
greatest insight, which is to say, the greatest hindsight and foresight,
declares that the series of experiences determining how all shall
live—orcanlive—has come to an end. The object now is to reap as
rich and as complete a harvest as possible from the days of experiment
andhardexperience. In consequence, the thing that is to be avoided
above everything is further experimentation—the continuation of the
state in which values are fluent, and are tested, chosen and criticizedad infinitum. Against this a double wall is set up: on the one hand,revelation, which is the assumption that the reasons lying behind the
laws arenotof human origin, that they werenotsoughtout and
found by a slow process and after many errors, but that they are of
divine ancestry, and came into being complete, perfect, without a
history, as a free gift, a miracle...; and on the other hand,tradition, which is the assumption that the law has stood unchanged
from time immemorial, and that it is impious and a crime against one’s
forefathers to bring it into question. The authority of the law is thus
grounded on the thesis: God gave it, and the fatherslivedit.—The
higher motive of such procedure lies in the design to distract
consciousness, step by step, from its concern with notions of right
living (that is to say, those that have beenprovedto be right by
wide and carefully considered experience), so that instinct attains to a
perfect automatism—a primary necessity to every sort of mastery, to
every sort of perfection in the art of life. To draw up such a law-book
as Manu’s means to lay before a people the possibility of future
mastery, of attainable perfection—it permits them to aspire to the
highest reaches of the art of life.To that end the thing must be made
unconscious: that is the aim of every holy lie.—Theorder of castes,
the highest, the dominating law, is merely the ratification of anorder
of nature, of a naturallaw of the first rank, over which no arbitrary
fiat, no “modern idea,” can exert any influence. In every healthy
society there are three physiological types, gravitating toward
differentiation but mutually conditioning one another, and each of these
has its own hygiene, its own sphere of work, its own special mastery and
feeling of perfection. It isnotManu but nature that sets off in one
class those who are chiefly intellectual, in another those who are
marked by muscular strength and temperament, and in a third those who
are distinguished in neither one way or the other, but show only
mediocrity—the last-named represents the great majority, and the first
two the select. The superior caste—I call it thefewest—has, as the
most perfect, the privileges of the few: it stands for happiness, for
beauty, for everything good upon earth. Only the most intellectual of
men have any right to beauty, to the beautiful; only in them can
goodness escape being weakness.Pulchrum est paucorum hominum:[30]goodness is a privilege. Nothing could be more unbecoming to them than
uncouth manners or a pessimistic look, or an eye that seesugliness—or indignation against the general aspect of things.
Indignation is the privilege of the Chandala; so is pessimism. “The
world is perfect”—so prompts the instinct of the intellectual, the
instinct of the man who says yes to life. “Imperfection, whatever isinferiorto us, distance, the pathos of distance, even the Chandala
themselves are parts of this perfection.” The most intelligent men, like
thestrongest, find their happiness where others would find only
disaster: in the labyrinth, in being hard with themselves and with
others, in effort; their delight is in self-mastery; in them asceticism
becomes second nature, a necessity, an instinct. They regard a difficult
task as a privilege; it is to them arecreationto play with burdens
that would crush all others.... Knowledge—a form of asceticism.—They
are the most honourable kind of men: but that does not prevent them
being the most cheerful and most amiable. They rule, not because they
want to, but because theyare; they are not at liberty to play
second.—Thesecond caste: to this belong the guardians of the law,
the keepers of order and security, the more noble warriors, above all,
the king as the highest form of warrior, judge and preserver of the law.
The second in rank constitute the executive arm of the intellectuals,
thenext to them in rank, taking from them all that isroughin the
business of ruling—their followers, their right hand, their most apt
disciples.—In all this, I repeat, there is nothing arbitrary, nothing
“made up”; whatever is to thecontraryis made up—by it nature is
brought to shame.... The order of castes, theorder of rank, simply
formulates the supreme law of life itself; the separation of the three
types is necessary to the maintenance of society, and to the evolution
of higher types, and the highest types—theinequalityof rights is
essential to the existence of any rights at all.—A right is a
privilege. Every one enjoys the privileges that accord with his state of
existence. Let us not underestimate the privileges of themediocre.
Life is always harder as one mounts theheights—the cold increases,
responsibility increases. A high civilization is a pyramid: it can stand
only on a broad base; its primary prerequisite is a strong and soundly
consolidated mediocrity. The handicrafts, commerce, agriculture,science, the greater part of art, in brief, the whole range ofoccupationalactivities, are compatible only with mediocre ability and
aspiration; such callings would be out of place for exceptional men; the
instinctswhich belong to them stand as much opposed to aristocracy as
to anarchism. The fact that a man is publicly useful, that he is a
wheel, a function, is evidence of a natural predisposition; it is notsociety, but the only sort of happiness that the majority are capable
of, that makes them intelligent machines. To the mediocre mediocrity is
a form of happiness; they have a natural instinct for mastering one
thing, for specialization. It would be altogether unworthy of a profound
intellect to see anything objectionable in mediocrity in itself. It is,
in fact, thefirstprerequisite to the appearance of the exceptional:
it is a necessary condition to a high degree of civilization. When the
exceptional man handles the mediocre man with more delicate fingers than
he applies to himself or to his equals, this is not merely kindness of
heart—it is simply hisduty.... Whom do I hate most heartily among
the rabbles of today? The rabble of Socialists, the apostles to the
Chandala, who undermine the workingman’s instincts, his pleasure, his
feeling of contentment with his petty existence—who make him envious
and teach him revenge.... Wrong never lies in unequal rights; it lies in
the assertion of “equal” rights.... What isbad? But I havealready
answered: all that proceeds from weakness, from envy, fromrevenge.—The anarchist and the Christian have the same ancestry....[30]Few men are noble.58.In point of fact, the end for which one lies makes a great difference:
whether one preserves thereby or destroys. There is a perfect likeness
between Christian and anarchist: their object, their instinct, points
only toward destruction. One need only turn to history for a proof of
this: there it appears with appalling distinctness. We have just studied
a code of religious legislation whose object it was to convert the
conditions which cause life toflourishinto an “eternal” social
organization,—Christianity found its mission in putting an end to such
an organization,because life flourished under it. There the benefits
that reason had produced during long ages of experiment and insecurity
were applied to the most remote uses, and an effort was made to bring in
a harvest that should be as large, as rich and as complete as possible;
here, on the contrary, the harvest isblightedovernight.... That
which stood thereaere perennis, theimperium Romanum, the most
magnificent form oforganization under difficult conditions that has
ever been achieved, and compared to which everything before it and after
it appears as patchwork, bungling,dilletantism—those holy anarchists
made it a matter of “piety” to destroy “the world,”which is to say,
theimperium Romanum, so that in the end not a stone stood upon
another—and even Germans and other such louts were able to become its
masters.... The Christian and the anarchist: both aredécadents; both
are incapable of any act that is not disintegrating, poisonous,
degenerating,blood-sucking; both have an instinct ofmortal hatredof everything that stands up, and is great, and has durability, and
promises life a future.... Christianity was the vampire of theimperium
Romanum,—overnight it destroyed the vast achievement of the Romans:
the conquest of the soil for a great culturethat could await its
time. Can it be that this fact is not yet understood? Theimperium
Romanumthat we know, and that the history of the Roman provinces
teaches us to know better and better,—this most admirable of all works
of art in the grand manner was merely the beginning, and the structure
to follow was not toproveits worth for thousands of years. To this
day, nothing on a like scalesub specie aeternihas been brought into
being, or even dreamed of!—This organization was strong enough to
withstand bad emperors: the accident of personality has nothing to do
with such things—thefirstprinciple of all genuinely great
architecture. But it was not strong enough to stand up against thecorruptestof all forms of corruption—against Christians.... These
stealthy worms, which under the cover of night, mist and duplicity,
crept upon every individual, sucking him dry of all earnest interest inrealthings, of all instinct forreality—this cowardly, effeminate
and sugar-coated gang gradually alienated all “souls,” step by step,
from that colossal edifice, turning against it all the meritorious,
manly and noble natures that had found in the cause of Rome their own
cause, their own serious purpose, their ownpride. The sneakishness of
hypocrisy, the secrecy of the conventicle, concepts as black as hell,
such as the sacrifice of the innocent, theunio mysticain the
drinking of blood, above all, the slowly rekindled fire of revenge, of
Chandala revenge—allthatsort of thing became master of Rome: the
same kind of religion which, in a pre-existent form, Epicurus had
combatted. One has but toread Lucretius to knowwhatEpicurus made
war upon—notpaganism, but “Christianity,” which is to say, the
corruption of souls by means of the concepts of guilt, punishment and
immortality.—He combatted thesubterraneancults, the whole of latent
Christianity—to deny immortality was already a form of genuinesalvation.—Epicurus had triumphed, and every respectable intellect in
Rome was Epicurean—when Paul appeared... Paul, the Chandala hatred
of Rome, of “the world,” in the flesh and inspired by genius—the Jew,
theeternalJewpar excellence.... What he saw was how, with the aid
of the small sectarian Christian movement that stood apart from Judaism,
a “world conflagration” might be kindled; how, with the symbol of “God
on the cross,” all secret seditions, all the fruits of anarchistic
intrigues in the empire, might be amalgamated into one immense power.
“Salvation is of the Jews.”—Christianity is the formula for exceedingandsumming up the subterranean cults of all varieties, that of
Osiris, that of the Great Mother, that of Mithras, for instance: in his
discernment of this fact the genius of Paul showed itself. His instinct
was here so sure that, with reckless violence to the truth, he putthe
ideas which lent fascination to every sort of Chandala religion into the
mouth of the “Saviour” as his own inventions, and not only into the
mouth—hemadeout of him something that even a priest of Mithras
could understand.... This was his revelation at Damascus: he grasped the
fact that heneededthe belief in immortality in order to rob “the
world” of its value, that the concept of “hell” would master Rome—that
the notion of a “beyond” is thedeath of life.... Nihilist and
Christian: they rhyme in German, and they do more than rhyme....59.The whole labour of the ancient world gone fornaught: I have no word
to describe the feelings that such an enormity arouses in me.—And,
considering the fact that its labour was merely preparatory, that with
adamantine self-consciousness it laid only the foundations for a work to
go on for thousands of years, the wholemeaningof antiquity
disappears!... To what end the Greeks? to what end the Romans?—All the
prerequisites to a learned culture, all themethodsof science, were
already there; man had already perfected the great and incomparable art
of reading profitably—that first necessity to the tradition of
culture, the unity of the sciences; the natural sciences, in alliance
with mathematics and mechanics, were on the right road,—the sense of
fact, the last and more valuable of all the senses, had its schools,
and its traditions were already centuries old! Is all this properly
understood? Everyessentialto the beginning of the work was
ready:—and themostessential, it cannot be said too often, are
methods, and also the most difficult to develop, and the longest opposed
by habit and laziness. What we have today reconquered, with unspeakable
self-discipline, for ourselves—for certain bad instincts, certain
Christian instincts, still lurk in our bodies—that is to say, the keen
eye for reality, the cautious hand, patience and seriousness in the
smallest things, the wholeintegrityof knowledge—all these things
were already there, and had been there for two thousand years!More,
there was also a refined and excellent tact and taste!Notas mere
brain-drilling!Notas “German” culture, with its loutish manners! But
as body, as bearing, as instinct—in short, as reality....All gone for
naught!Overnight it became merely a memory!—The Greeks! The Romans!Instinctive nobility, taste, methodical inquiry, genius for organization
and administration, faith in and thewillto secure the future of man,
a great yes to everything entering into theimperium Romanumand
palpable to all the senses, a grand style that was beyond mere art, but
had become reality, truth,life....—All overwhelmed in a night, but
not by a convulsion of nature! Not trampled to death by Teutons and
others of heavy hoof! But brought to shame by crafty, sneaking,
invisible, anæmic vampires! Not conquered,—only sucked dry!... Hidden
vengefulness, petty envy, becamemaster! Everything wretched,
intrinsically ailing, and invaded by bad feelings, the wholeghetto-worldof the soul, was at onceon top!—One needs but read
any of the Christian agitators, for example, St. Augustine, in order to
realize, in order to smell, what filthy fellows came to the top. It
would be an error, however, to assume that there was any lack of
understanding in the leaders of the Christian movement:—ah, but they
were clever, clever to the point of holiness, these fathers of the
church! What they lacked was something quite different. Nature
neglected—perhaps forgot—to give them even the mostmodest endowment
of respectable, of upright, ofcleanlyinstincts.... Between
ourselves, they are not even men.... If Islam despises Christianity, it
has a thousandfold right to do so: Islam at least assumes that it is
dealing withmen....60.Christianity destroyed for us the whole harvest of ancient civilization,
and later it also destroyed for us the whole harvest ofMohammedancivilization. The wonderful culture of the Moors in Spain, which was
fundamentally nearer tousand appealed more to our senses and tastes
than that of Rome and Greece, wastrampled down(—I do not say by
what sort of feet—) Why? Because it had to thank noble and manly
instincts for its origin—because it said yes to life, even to the rare
and refined luxuriousness of Moorish life!... The crusaders later made
war on something before which it would have been more fitting for them
to have grovelled in the dust—a civilization beside which even that of
our nineteenth century seems very poor and very “senile.”—What they
wanted, of course, was booty: the orient was rich.... Let us putaside
our prejudices! The crusades were a higher form of piracy, nothing more!
The German nobility, which is fundamentally a Viking nobility, was in
its element there: the church knew only too well how the German nobility
was to bewon.... The German noble, always the “Swiss guard” of the
church, always in the service of every bad instinct of the church—but
well paid.... Consider the fact that it is precisely the aid of German
swords and German blood and valour that has enabled the church to carry
through its war to the death upon everything noble on earth! At this
point a host of painful questions suggest themselves. The German
nobility standsoutsidethe history of the higher civilization: the
reason is obvious.... Christianity, alcohol—the twogreatmeans of
corruption.... Intrinsically there should be no more choice between
Islam and Christianity than there is between an Arab and a Jew. The
decision is already reached; nobody remains at liberty to choose here.
Either a man is a Chandala or he is not.... “War to the knife with Rome!
Peace and friendship with Islam!”: this was the feeling, this was theact, of that great free spirit, that genius among German emperors,
FrederickII. What! must a German first be a genius, a free spirit,
before he can feeldecently? I can’t make out how a German could ever
feelChristian....61.Here it becomes necessary to call up a memory that must be a hundred
times more painful to Germans. The Germans have destroyed for Europe the
last great harvest of civilization that Europe was ever to reap—theRenaissance. Is it understood at last,willit ever be understood,whatthe Renaissance was?The transvaluation of Christian
values,—an attempt with all available means, all instincts and all the
resources of genius to bring about a triumph of theoppositevalues,
the morenoblevalues.... This has been the one great war of the past;
there has never been a more critical question than that of the
Renaissance—it ismyquestion too—; there has never been a form ofattackmore fundamental, more direct, or more violently delivered by a
whole front upon the center of the enemy! To attack at the critical
place, at the very seat of Christianity, and there enthrone the more
noble values—that is to say, toinsinuatethem into theinstincts,
into the most fundamental needs and appetites of those sitting there....
I see before me thepossibilityof a perfectly heavenly enchantment
and spectacle:—it seems to me to scintillate with all the vibrations of
a fine and delicate beauty, and within it there is an art so divine, so
infernally divine, that one might search in vain for thousands of years
for another such possibility; I see a spectacle so rich in significance
and at the same time so wonderfully full of paradox that it should
arouse all the gods on Olympus to immortal laughter—Cæsar Borgia as
pope!... Am I understood?... Well then,thatwould have been the
sort of triumph thatIalone am longing for today—: by itChristianitywould have beenswept away!—What
happened? A German monk, Luther, came to Rome. This monk, with all the
vengeful instincts of an unsuccessful priest in him, raised a rebellionagainstthe Renaissance in Rome.... Instead of grasping, with profound
thanksgiving, the miracle that had taken place: the conquest of
Christianity at itscapital—instead of this, his hatred was
stimulated by the spectacle. A religious man thinks only of
himself.—Luther saw only thedepravityof the papacy at the very
moment when the opposite was becoming apparent: the old corruption, thepeccatum originale, Christianity itself, no longer occupied the papal
chair! Instead there was life! Instead there was the triumph of life!
Instead there was a great yea to all lofty, beautiful and daring
things!... And Lutherrestored the church: he attacked it.... The
Renaissance—an event without meaning, a great futility!—Ah, these
Germans, what they have not cost us!Futility—that has always been
the work of the Germans.—The Reformation;Leibnitz; Kant
and so-called German philosophy; the war of “liberation”; the
empire—every time a futile substitute for something that once existed,
for somethingirrecoverable.... These Germans, I confess, are my
enemies: I despise all their uncleanliness in concept and valuation,
their cowardice before every honest yea and nay. For nearly a thousand
years they have tangled and confused everything their fingers have
touched; they have on their conscience all the half-way measures, all
the three-eighths-way measures, that Europe is sick of,—they also have
on their conscience the uncleanest variety of Christianity that exists,
and the most incurable and indestructible—Protestantism.... If mankind
never manages to get rid of Christianity theGermanswill be to
blame....62.—With this I come to a conclusion and pronounce my judgment. IcondemnChristianity; I bring against the Christian church the most
terrible of all the accusations that an accuser has ever had in his
mouth. It is, to me, the greatest of all imaginable corruptions; it
seeks to work the ultimate corruption, the worst possible corruption.
The Christian church has left nothing untouched by its depravity; it has
turned every value into worthlessness, and every truth into a lie, and
every integrity into baseness of soul. Let any one dare to speak to me
of its “humanitarian” blessings! Its deepest necessities range it
against any effort to abolish distress; it lives by distress; itcreatesdistress to makeitselfimmortal.... For example, the worm
of sin: it was the church that first enriched mankind with this
misery!—The “equality of souls before God”—this fraud, thispretextfor therancunesof all the base-minded—this explosive concept,
ending in revolution, the modern idea, and the notion of overthrowing
the whole social order—this isChristiandynamite.... The
“humanitarian”blessings of Christianity forsooth! To breed out ofhumanitasa self-contradiction, an art of self-pollution, a will to
lie at any price, an aversion and contempt for all good and honest
instincts! All this, to me, is the “humanitarianism” of
Christianity!—Parasitism as theonlypractice of the church; with its
anæmic and “holy” ideals, sucking all the blood, all the love, all the
hope out of life; the beyond as the will to deny all reality; the cross
as the distinguishing mark of the most subterranean conspiracy ever
heard of,—against health, beauty, well-being, intellect,kindnessof
soul—against life itself....This eternal accusation against Christianity I shall write upon all
walls, wherever walls are to be found—I have letters that even the
blind will be able to see.... I call Christianity the one great curse,
the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct of revenge,
for which no means are venomous enough, or secret, subterranean andsmallenough,—I call it the one immortal blemish upon the human
race....And mankind reckonstimefrom thedies nefastuswhen this fatality
befell—from thefirstday of Christianity!—Why not rather from its
last?—From today?—The transvaluation of all values!...THE END
