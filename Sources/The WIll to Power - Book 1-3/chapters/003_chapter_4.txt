Theholy lie,therefore, applies principally to thepurposeof
an action (the natural purpose, reason, is made to vanish: a moral
purpose, the observance of some law, a service to God, seems to be the
purpose): to theconsequenceof an action (the natural consequence
is interpreted as something supernatural, and, in order to be on
surer ground, other incontrollable and supernatural consequences are
foretold).In this way the conceptsgoodandevilare created, and seem
quite divorced from the natural concepts: "useful," "harmful,"
"life-promoting," "life-retarding,"—indeed, inasmuch asanotherlifeis imagined, the former concepts may even beantagonisticto
Nature's concepts of good and evil. In this way, the proverbial concept
"conscience" is created: an inner voice, which, though it makes itself
heard in regard to every action, does not measure the worth of that
action according to its results, but according to its conformity or
non-conformity to the "law."The holy lie therefore invented: (1) agodwhopunishesandrewards,who recognises and carefully observes the law-book of the
priests, and who is particular about sending them into the world as
his mouthpieces and plenipotentiaries; (2) anAfter Life,in which,
alone, the great penal machine is supposed to be active—to this end
theimmortality of the soulwas invented; (3) aconscience in
man,understood as the knowledge that good and evil are permanent
values—that God himself speaks through it, whenever its counsels are
in conformity with priestly precepts; (4)Moralityas the denial of
all natural processes, as the subjection of all phenomena to a moral
order, as the interpretation of all phenomena as the effects of a moral
order of things (that is to say, the concept of punishment and reward),
as the only power and only creator of all transformations; (5)Truthsgiven, revealed, and identical with the teaching of the priests: as the
condition to all salvation and happiness in this and the next world.In short: what is the price paid for theimprovementsupposed
to be due to morality?—The unhinging ofreason,the reduction of
all motives to fear and hope (punishment and reward);dependenceupon the tutelage of priests, and upon a formulary exactitude
which is supposed to express a divine will; the implantation of
a "conscience" which establishes a false science in the place of
experience and experiment: as though all one had to do or had not
to do were predetermined—a kind of contraction of the seeking and
striving spirit;—in short: the worstmutilationof man that can be
imagined, and it is pretended that "the good man" is the result.Practically speaking, all reason, the whole heritage of intelligence,
subtlety, and caution, the first condition of the priestly canon, is
arbitrarily reduced, when it is too late, to a simplemechanicalprocess: conformity with the law becomes a purpose in itself, it is the
highest purpose;Life no longer contains any problems;—the whole
conception of the world is polluted by the notion ofpunishment;
—Life itself, owing to the fact that thepriests lifeis upheld as
thenon plus ultraof perfection, is transformed into a denial and
pollution of life;—the concept "God" represents an aversion to Life,
and even a criticism and a contemning of it. Truth is transformed in
the mind, intopriestlyprevarication; the striving after truth, into
thestudy of the Scriptures,into the way tobecome a theologian.142.A criticism of the Law-Book of Manu.—The whole book is founded upon
the holy lie. Was it the well-being of humanity that inspired the whole
of this system? Was this kind of man,who believes in theinterestednature of every action, interested or not interested in the success
of this system? The desire to improve mankind—whence comes the
inspiration to this feeling? Whence is the concept improvement taken?We find a class of men,the sacerdotal class,who consider themselves
the standard pattern, the highest example and most perfect expression
of the type man. The notion of "improving" mankind, to this class of
men, means to make mankind like themselves. They believe in their own
superiority, theywillbe superior in practice: the cause of the holy
lie isThe Will to Power....Establishment of the dominion: to this end, ideas which place anon
plus ultraof power with the priesthood are made to prevail. Power
acquired by lying was the result of the recognition of the fact that it
was not already possessed physically, in a military form.... Lying as a
supplement to power—this is a new concept of "truth."It is a mistake to presupposeunconsciousandinnocentdevelopment
in this quarter—a sort of self-deception. Fanatics are not the
discoverers of such exhaustive systems of oppression.... Cold-blooded
reflection must have been at work here; the same sort of reflection
which Plato showed when he worked out his "State"—"One must desire the
means when one desires the end." Concerning this political maxim, all
legislators have always been quite clear.We possess the classical model, and it is specifically Arian: we
can therefore hold the mostgifted and most reflective type of man
responsible for the most systematic lie that has ever been told....
Everywhere almost the lie was copied, and thusAvian influencecorrupted the world....143.Much is said to-day about theSemiticspirit of theNew Testament:
but the thing referred to is merely priestcraft,—and in the purest
example of an Arian law-book, in Manu, this kind of "Semitic
spirit"—that is to say,Sacerdotalism,is worse than anywhere else.The development of the Jewish hierarchy isnotoriginal: they learnt
the scheme in Babylon—it is Arian. When, later on, the same thing
became dominant in Europe, under the preponderance of Germanic blood,
this was in conformity to the spirit of theruling race: a striking
case of atavism. The Germanic middle ages aimed at a revival of theArian order of castes.Mohammedanism in its turn learned from Christianity the use of a
"Beyond" as an instrument of punishment.The scheme of apermanent community,with priests at its
head—this oldest product of Asia's great culture in the domain of
organisation—naturallyprovoked reflection and imitation in every
way.—Plato is an example of this, but above all, the Egyptians.144.Moralitiesandreligionsare the principal means by which one can
modify men into whatever one; provided one is possessed of an
overflow of creative power, and can cause one's will to prevail over
long periods of time.145.If one wish to see anaffirmativeArian religion which is the product
of arulingclass, one should read the law-book of Manu. (The
deification of the feeling of power in the Brahmin: it is interesting
to note that it originated in the warrior-caste, and was later
transferred to the priests.)If one wish to see anaffirmativereligion of the Semitic order,
which is the product of therulingclass, one should read the Koran
or the earlier portions of the Old Testament. (Mohammedanism,as a
religion for men, has profound contempt for the sentimentality and
prevarication of Christianity, ... which, according to Mohammedans, is
a woman's religion.)If one wish to see anegativereligion of the Semitic order, which is
the product of theoppressedclass, one should read the New Testament
(which, according to Indian and Arian points of view, is a religion for
the Chandala).If one wish to see anegativeArian religion, which is the product of
therulingclasses, one should study Buddhism.It is quite in the nature of things that we have no Arian religion
which is the product of theoppressedclasses; for that would have
been a contradiction: a race of masters is either paramount or else it
goes to the dogs.146.Religion,per se,has nothing to do with morality; yet both offshoots
of the Jewish religion areessentiallymoral religions—which
prescribe the rules of living, and procure obedience to their
principles by means of rewards and punishment.147.Paganism—Christianity.—Paganismis that which says yea to all
that is natural, it is innocence in being natural, "naturalness."Christianityis that which says no to all that is natural, it is a
certain lack of dignity in being natural; hostility to Nature."Innocent":—Petronius is innocent, for instance. Beside this happy
man a Christian is absolutely devoid of innocence. But since even
theChristianstatus is ultimately only a natural condition, the
term "Christian" soon begins to mean thecounterfeiting of the
psychological interpretation.148.The Christian priest is from the root a mortal enemy of sensuality: one
cannot imagine a greater contrast to his attitude than the guileless,
slightly awed, and solemn attitude, which the religious rites of the
most honourable women in Athens maintained in the presence of the
symbol of sex. In all non-ascetic religions the procreative act isthesecretper se: a sort of symbol of perfection and of the
designs of the future: re-birth, immortality.149.Our belief in ourselves is the greatest fetter, the most telling spur,
and thestrongest pinion.Christianity ought to have elevated the
innocence of man to the position of an article of belief—men would
then have become gods: in those days believing was still possible.150.The egregiouslieof history: as if it were thecorruptionof
Paganism that opened the road to Christianity. As a matter of fact, it
was the enfeeblement andmoralisationof the man of antiquity. The
new interpretation of natural functions, which made them appear likevices,had already gone before!151.Religions are ultimately wrecked by the belief in morality. The idea of
the Christian moral God becomes untenable,—hence "Atheism,"—as though
there could be no other god.Cultureis likewise wrecked by the belief in morality. For when the
necessary and only possible conditions of its growth are revealed,
nobodywillany longer countenance it (Buddhism).152.The physiology of Nihilistic religions.—All in all, theNihilisticreligions aresystematised histories of sicknessdescribed in
religious and moral terminology.In pagan cultures it is around the interpretation of the great annual
cycles that the religious cult turns; in Christianity it is around a
cycle ofparalytic phenomena.153.ThisNihilisticreligion gathers together all thedecadent elementsand things of like order which it can find in antiquity, viz.:—(a)Theweakand thebotched(the refuse of the ancient world,
and that of which it rid itself with most violence).(b)Those who aremorally obsessedandanti-pagan.(c)Those who areweary of politicsand indifferent (theblaséRomans), thedenationalised,who know not what they are.(d)Those who are tired of themselves—who are happy to be party to a
subterranean conspiracy.154.BuddhaversusChrist.—Among the Nihilistic religions, Christianity
andBuddhismmay always be sharply distinguished.Buddhismis the
expression of afine evening,perfectly sweet and mild—it is a sort
of gratitude towards all thatlies hidden, including that which it
entirely lacks, viz., bitterness, disillusionment, and resentment.
Finally it possesses lofty intellectual love; it has got over all
the subtlety of philosophical contradictions, and is even resting
after it, though it is precisely from that source that it derives its
intellectual glory and its glow as of a sunset (it originated in the
higher classes).Christianityis a degenerative movement, consisting of all kinds
of decaying and excremental elements: it isnotthe expression of
the downfall of a race, it is, from the root, an agglomeration of all
the morbid elements which are mutually attractive and which gravitate
to one another.... It is thereforenota national religion,notdetermined by race: it appeals to the disinherited everywhere; it
consists of a foundation of resentment against all that is successful
and dominant: it is in need of a symbol which represents the damnation
of everything successful and dominant. It is opposed to every form ofintellectualmovement, to all philosophy: it takes up the cudgels for
idiots, and utters a curse upon all intellect. Resentment against those
who are gifted, learned, intellectually independent: in all these it
suspects the element of success and domination.155.In Buddhism this thought prevails: "All passions, everything which
creates emotions and leads to blood, is a call to action"—to this
extent alone are its believerswarnedagainst evil.For action has
no sense, it merely binds one to existence. All existence, however, has
no sense. Evil is interpreted as that which leads to irrationalism:
to the affirmation of means whose end is denied. A road to nonentity
is the desideratum,hence allemotional impulses are regarded with
horror. For instance: "On no account seek after revenge! Be the enemy
of no one!"—The Hedonism of the weary finds its highest expression
here. Nothing is more utterly foreign to Buddhism than the Jewish
fanaticism of St. Paul: nothing could be more contrary to its instinct
than the tension, fire, and unrest of the religious man, and, above
all, that form of sensuality which sanctifies Christianity with the
name "Love." Moreover, it is the cultured and very intellectual classes
who find blessedness in Buddhism: a race wearied and besotted by
centuries of philosophical quarrels, but notbeneath all cultureas
those classes were from which Christianity sprang.... In the Buddhistic
ideal, there is essentially an emancipation from good and evil: a
very subtle suggestion of a Beyond to all morality is thought out
in its teaching, and this Beyond is supposed to be compatible with
perfection,—the condition being, that even good actions are only
neededpro tem.,merely as a means,—that is to say, in order to be
free fromallaction.156.How very curiousit is to see aNihilisticreligion such as
Christianity, sprung from, and in keeping with, a decrepit and worn-out
people, who haveoutlived all strong instincts, being transferred step
by step to another environment—that is to say, to a land of young
people,who have not yet lived at all.The joy of the final chapter,
of the fold and of the evening, preached to barbarians and Germans!
How thoroughly all of it must first have been barbarised, Germanised!
To those who had dreamed of aWalhalla: who found happiness only in
war!—Asupernational religion preached in the midst of chaos, whereno nations yet existed even.157.The only way to refute priests and religions is this: to show that
their errors are no longerbeneficent—that they are rather harmful;
in short, that their own "proof of power" no longer holds good....2. CONCERNING THE HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY.158.Christianity as anhistorical realityshould not be confounded with
that one root which its name recalls. Theotherroots, from which it
has sprung, are by far the more important. It is an unprecedented abuse
of names to identify such manifestations of decay and such abortions as
the "Christian Church," "Christian belief," and "Christian life," with
that Holy Name. What did Christdeny?—Everything which to-day is
called Christian.159.The whole of the Christiancreed—all Christian "truth," is idle
falsehood and deception, and is precisely the reverse of that which was
at the bottom of the first Christian movement.All that which in theecclesiasticalsense is Christian, is just
exactly what is most radicallyanti-Christian: crowds of things and
people appear instead of symbols, history takes the place of eternal
facts, it is all forms, rites, and dogmas instead of a "practice" of
life. To be really Christian would mean to be absolutely indifferent to
dogmas, cults, priests, church, and theology.The practice of Christianity is no more an impossible phantasy than the
practice of Buddhism is: it is merely a means to happiness.160.Jesus goes straight to the point, the "Kingdom of Heaven" in the heart,
and He doesnotfind the means in duty to the Jewish Church; He
even regards the reality of Judaism (its need to maintain itself) as
nothing; He is concerned purely with theinnerman.Neither does He make anything of all the coarse forms relating to man's
intercourse with God: He is opposed to the whole of the teaching of
repentance and atonement; He points out how man ought to live in order
to feel himself "deified," and how futile it is on his part to hope to
live properly by showing repentance and contritionfor his sins. "Sin
is of no account" is practically his chief standpoint.Sin, repentance, forgiveness,—all this does not belong to Christianity
... it is Judaism or Paganism which has become mixed up with Christ's
teaching.161.TheKingdom of Heavenis a state of the heart (of children it is
written, "for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven"): it has nothing to
do with superterrestrial things. The Kingdom of God "cometh," not
chronologically or historically, not on a certain day in the calendar;
it is not something which one day appears and was not previously there;
it is a "change of feeling in the individual," it is something which
may come at any time and which may be absent at any time....162.The thief on the cross;—When the criminal himself, who endures a
painful death, declares: "the way this Jesus suffers and dies, without
a murmur of revolt or enmity, graciously and resignedly, is the only
right way," he assents to the gospel; and by this very facthe is in
Paradise....163.Jesus bids us:—not to resist, either by deeds or in our heart, him who
ill-treats us;He bids us admit of no grounds for separating ourselves from our wives;He bids us make no distinction between foreigners and
fellow-countrymen, strangers and familiars;He bids us show anger to no one, and treat no one with contempt;—give
alms secretly; not to desire to become rich;—not to swear;—not to
stand in judgment;—become reconciled with our enemies and forgive
offences;—not to worship in public."Blessedness" is nothing promised: it is here, with us, if we only wish
to live and act in a particular way.164.Subsequent Additions;—The whole of the prophet- and
thaumaturgist-attitudes and the bad temper; while the conjuring-up of a
supreme tribunal of justice is an abominable corruption (see Mark vi.
11: "And whosoever shall not receive you.... Verily I say unto you, It
shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha," etc.). The "fig tree"
(Matt. xxi. 18, 19): "Now in the morning as he returned into the city,
he hungered. And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and
found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit
grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered
away."165.The teaching of rewards and punishments has become mixed up with
Christianity in a way which is quite absurd; everything is thereby
spoilt.In the same way, the practice of the firstecclesia
militans,of the Apostle Paul and his attitude, is put forward as if
it had beencommandedor predetermined.The subsequent glorification of the actuallifeandteachingof the
first Christians: as if everything had beenprescribed beforehandand
had been only a matter offollowingdirections——And as for thefulfilment of scriptural prophecies: how much of all that is more
than forgery and cooking?166.Jesus opposed a real life, a life in truth, to ordinary life: nothing
could have been more foreign to His mind than the somewhat heavy
nonsense of an "eternal Peter,"—of the eternal duration of a single
person. Precisely what He combats is the exaggerated importance of the
"person": how can He wish to immortalise it?He likewise combats the hierarchy within the community; He never
promises a certain proportion of reward for a certain proportion of
deserts: how can He have meant to teach the doctrine of punishment and
reward in a Beyond?167.Christianity is an ingenuous attempt at bringing about aBuddhistic
movement in favour of peace,sprung from the very heart of the
resenting masses ... but transformed byPaulinto a mysterious
pagan cult, which was ultimately able to accordwith the whole ofState organisation... and which carries on war, condemns, tortures,
conjures, and hates.Paul bases his teaching upon the need of mystery felt by the great
masses capable of religious emotions: he seeks avictim,a bloody
phantasmagoria, which may be equal to a contest with the images of
a secret cult: God on the cross, the drinking of blood, theunio
mysticawith the "victim."He seeks the prolongation of life after death (the blessed and atoned
after-life of the individual soul) which he puts in causal relation
with thevictimalready referred to (according to the type of
Dionysos, Mithras, Osiris).He feels the necessity of bringing notions ofguiltandsininto the foreground,nota new practice of life (as Jesus Himself
demonstrated and taught), but a new cult, a new belief, a belief in a
miraculous metamorphosis ("Salvation" through belief).He understood thegreat needs of the pagan worldsand he gave quite
an absolutely arbitrary picture of those two plain facts, Christ's life
and death. He gave the whole a new accent, altering the equilibrium
everywhere ... he was one of the most active destroyers of primitive
Christianity.The attempt made on the life ofpriests and theologiansculminated,
thanks to Paul, in a new priesthood and theology—arulingcaste and
aChurch.The attempt made to suppress the fussy importance of the "person,"
culminated in the belief in the eternal "personality" (and in the
anxiety concerning "eternal salvation" ...), and in themost
paradoxical exaggeration of individual egoism.This is the humorous side of the question—tragic humour: Paul again
set up on a large scale precisely what Jesus had overthrown by His
life. At last, when the Church edifice was complete, it even sanctioned
theexistenceof theState.168.The Church is precisely that against which Jesus inveighed—and against
which He taught His disciples to fight.169.A God who died for our sins, salvation through faith, resurrection
after death—all these things are the counterfeit coins of real
Christianity, for which that pernicious blockhead Paul must be held
responsible.Thelife which must serve as an exampleconsists in love and
humility; in the abundance of hearty emotion which does not even
exclude the lowliest; in the formal renunciation of all desire of
making its rights felt; in conquest, in the sense of triumph over
oneself; in the belief in salvation in this world, despite all sorrow,
opposition, and death; in forgiveness and the absence of anger and
contempt; in the absence of a desire to be rewarded; in the refusal
to be bound to anybody; abandonment to all that is most spiritual and
intellectual;—in fact, a very proud life controlled by the will of a
servile and poor life.Once the Church had allowed itself to take overall the Christian
practice,and had formally sanctioned the State,—that kind of life
which Jesus combats and condemns,—it was obliged to lay the sense
of Christianity in other things than early Christian ideals—that is
to say, in thefaithin incredible things, in the ceremonial of
prayers, worship, feasts, etc. etc. The notions "sin," "forgiveness,"
"punishment," "reward"—everything, in fact, which had nothing in
common with, and was quiteabsentfrom, primitive Christianity, now
comes into the foreground.An appalling stew of Greek philosophy and Judaism; asceticism;
continual judgments and condemnations; the order of rank, etc.170.Christianity has, from the first, always transformed the symbolical
into crude realities:(1) The antitheses "true life" and "false life" were misunderstood and
changed into "life here" and "life beyond."(2) The notion "eternal life," as opposed to the personal life which is
ephemeral, is translated into "personal immortality";(3) The process of fraternising by means of sharing the same food and
drink, after the Hebrew-Arabian manner, is interpreted as the "miracle
of transubstantiation."(4) "Resurrection" which was intended tomean the entrance to the
"true life," in the sense of being intellectually "born again," becomes
an historical contingency, supposed to take place at some moment after
death;(5) The teaching of the Son of man as the "Son of God,"—that is to
say, the life-relationship between man and God,—becomes the "second
person of the Trinity," and thus the filial relationship of every
man—even the lowest—to God, isdone away with;(6) Salvation through faith (that is to say, that there is no other way
to this filial relationship to God, save through thepractice of lifetaught by Christ) becomes transformed into the belief that there is a
miraculous way ofatoningfor allsin; though not through our own
endeavours, but by means of Christ:For all these purposes, "Christ on the Cross" had to be interpreted
afresh. Thedeathitself would certainly not be the principal feature
of the event ... it was only another sign pointing to the way in
which one should behave towards the authorities and the laws of the
world—that one was not to defend oneself—this was the exemplary
life.171.Concerning the psychology ofPaul.—The important fact is Christ's
death. This remains to beexplained .... That there may be truth or
error in an explanation never entered these people's heads: one day a
sublime possibility strikes them, "His deathmightmean so and so"—and it forthwithbecomesso and so. An hypothesis is proved by the
sublimeardourit lends to its discoverer...."The proof of strength":i.e.,a thought is demonstrated by itseffects("by their fruits," as the Bible ingenuously says); that
which fires enthusiasm must betrue,—what one loses one's blood for
must betrue—In every department of this world of thought, the sudden feeling of
power which an idea imparts to him who is responsible for it, is
placed to thecreditof that idea:—and as there seems no other way
of honouring an idea than by calling it true, the first epithet it is
honoured with is the wordtrue.... How could it have any effect
otherwise? It was imagined by some power: if that power were not
real, it could not be the cause of anything.... The thought is then
understood asinspired: the effect it causes has something of the
violent nature of a demoniacal influence—A thought which a decadent like Paul could not resist and to which he
completely yields, is thus "proved"true!!!All these holy epileptics and visionaries did not possess a thousandth
part of the honesty in self-criticism with which a philologist,
nowadays, reads a text, or tests the truth of an historical event....
Beside us, such people were moral cretins.172.It matters littlewhether a thing be true,provided it beeffective: totalabsence of intellectual uprightness.Everything
is good, whether it be lying, slander, or shameless "cooking," provided
it serve to heighten the degree of heat to the point at which people
"believe."We are face to face with an actual school for the teaching ofthe
means wherewithmen areseducedto a belief: we see systematiccontemptfor those spheres whence contradiction might come (that
is to say, for reason, philosophy, wisdom, doubt, and caution); a
shameless praising and glorification of the teaching, with continual
references to the fact that it was God who presented us with it—that
the apostle signifies nothing—that no criticism is brooked, but
only faith, acceptance; that it is the greatest blessing and favour
to receive such a doctrine of salvation; that the state in which one
should receive it, ought to be one of the profoundest thankfulness and
humility....The resentment which the lowly feel against all those in high places,
is continually turned to account: the fact that this teaching is
revealed to them as the reverse of the wisdom of the world, against
the power of the world, seduces them to it. This teaching convinces
the outcasts and the botched of all sorts and conditions; it promises
blessedness, advantages, and privileges to the most insignificant and
most humble men; it fanaticises the poor, the small, and the foolish,
and fills them with insane vanity, as thoughtheywere the meaning
and salt of the earth.Again, I say, all this cannot be sufficiently contemned, we spare
ourselves a criticism of theteaching; it is sufficient to take
note of the means it uses in order to be aware of the nature of the
phenomenon one is examining. It identified itself withvirtue,it appropriated the whole of thefascinating power of virtue,shamelessly, for its own purposes ... it availed itself of the power of
paradox, and of the need, manifested by old civilisation, for pepper
and absurdity; it amazed and revolted at the same time; it provoked
persecutions and ill-treatment.It is the same kind ofwell-thought-out meannesswith which the
Jewish priesthood established their power and built up their Church....One must be able to discern: (1) that warmth of passion "love" (resting
on a base of ardent sensuality); (2) the thoroughlyignoble characterof Christianity:—the continual exaggeration and verbosity;—the lack
of cool intellectuality and irony;—the unmilitary character of all its
instincts;—the priestly prejudices against manly pride, sensuality,
the sciences, the arts.173.Paul: seeks poweragainstruling Judaism,—his attempt is too
weak.... Transvaluation of the notion "Jew": the "race" is put aside:
but that means denying the very basis of the whole structure. The
"martyr," the "fanatic," the value of allstrongbelief. Christianity
is theform of decayof the old world, after the latter's collapse,
and it is characterised by the fact that it brings all the most sickly
and unhealthy elements and needs to the top.Consequently otherinstincts had to step into the foreground, in
order toconstitutean entity, a power able to stand alone—in short,
a condition of tense sorrow was necessary, like that out of which the
Jews had derived theirinstinct of self-preservation....The persecution of Christians was invaluable for this purpose.Unity in the face of danger; the conversion of the masses becomes the
only means of putting an end to the persecution of the individual. (The
notion "conversion" is therefore made as elastic as possible.)174.TheChristian Judaiclife: here resentment did not prevail. The
great persecutions alone could have driven out the passions to that
extent—as also theardour of loveandhate.When the creatures a man most loves are sacrificed before his eyes for
the sake of his faith, that man becomesaggressive; the triumph of
Christianity is due to its persecutors.Asceticismis not specifically Christian: this is what Schopenhauer
misunderstood. It only shoots up in Christianity, wherever it would
have existed without that religion.Melancholy Christianity, the torture and torment of the conscience,
also only a peculiarity of a particular soil, where Christian values
have taken root: it is not Christianity properly speaking. Christianity
has absorbed all the different kinds of diseases which grow from morbid
soil: one couldrefute it at one blow by showing that it did not know
how to resist any contagion. Butthatprecisely is the essential
feature of it. Christianity is a type of decadence.175.The reality on which Christianity was able to build up its power
consisted of the small dispersedJewish families,with their warmth,
tenderness, and peculiar readiness to help, which, to the whole of the
Roman Empire, was perhaps the most incomprehensible and least familiar
of their characteristics; they were also united by their pride at
being a "chosen people," concealed beneath a cloak of humility, and by
their secret denial of all that was uppermost and that possessed power
and splendour, although there was no shade of envy in their denial.To have recognised this as a power,to have regarded thisblessedstate as communicable, seductive, and infectious even where pagans
were concerned—this constituted Paul's genius: to use up the treasure
of latent energy and cautious happiness for the purposes of "a Jewish
Church of free confession," and to avail himself of all the Jewish
experience, their propaganda, and their expertness inthe preservation
of a communityunder a foreign power—this is what he conceived to
be his duty. He it was who discovered that absolutely unpolitical and
isolated body ofpaltry people,and their art of asserting themselves
and pushing themselves to the front, by means of a host of acquired
virtues which aremade to represent the only forms of virtue ("the
self-preservative measure and weapon of success of a certain class of
man").The principle oflovecomes from the small community of Jewish
people: avery passionatesoul glows here, beneath the ashes of
humility and wretchedness: it is neither Greek, Indian, nor German. The
song in praise of love which Paul wrote is not Christian; it is the
Jewish flare of that eternal flame which is Semitic. If Christianity
has done anything essentially new in a psychological sense, it is this,
that it hasincreased the temperature of the soulamong those cooler
and more noble races who were at one time at the head of affairs;
it discovered that the most wretched life could be made rich and
invaluable, by means of an elevation of the temperature of the soul....It is easily understood that a transfer of this sort couldnottake place among the ruling classes: the Jews and Christians were at
a disadvantage owing to their bad manners—spiritual strength and
passion, when accompanied by bad manners, only provoke loathing (I
become aware of these bad manners while reading the New Testament). It
was necessary to be related both in baseness and sorrow with this type
of lower manhood in order to feel anything attractive in him.... The
attitude a man maintains towards the New Testament is a test of the
amount of taste he may have for the classics (see Tacitus); he who is
not revolted by it, he who does not feel honestly and deeply that he is
in the presence of a sort offœda superstitiowhen reading it, and
who does not drawhis hand back so as not to soil his fingers—such a
man does not know what is classical. A man must feel about "the cross"
as Goethe did.[1][1]Vieles kann ich ertragen.

Things the most irksomeI endure with such patience as comes from a god.Four things, however, repulse me like venom:—Tobaccosmoke, garlic, bugs, and the cross.(TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.)176.The reaction of paltry people:—Love provides the feeling of highest
power. It should be understood to what extent, not man in general, but
only a certain kind of man is speaking here."We are godly in love, we shall be 'the children of God'; God loves us
and wants nothing from us save love"; that is to say: all morality,
obedience, and action, do not produce the same feeling of power and
freedom as love does;—a man does nothing wicked from sheer love, but
he does much more than if he were prompted by obedience and virtue
alone.Here is the happiness of the herd, the communal feeling in big things
as in small, the living sentiment of unity felt as thesum of the
feeling of life.Helping, caring for, and being useful, constantly
kindle the feeling of power; visible success, theexpression of
pleasure, emphasise the feeling of power; pride is not lacking either,
it is felt in the form of the community, the House of God, and the
"chosen people."As a matter of fact, man has once more experienced an "altération" of
his personality: this time he called his feeling of love—God. The
awakening of such a feeling must be pictured; it is a sort of ecstasy,
a strange language, a "Gospel"—it was this newness which did not
allow man to attribute love to himself—he thought it was God leading
him on and taking shape in his heart. "God descends among men," one's
neighbour is transfigured and becomes a God (in so far as he provokes
the sentiment of love),Jesus is the neighbour,the moment He is
transfigured in thought into a God, and into a causeprovoking the
feeling of power.177.Believers are aware that they owe an infinite amount to Christianity,
and therefore conclude that its Founder must have been a man of the
first rank.... This conclusion is false, but it is typical of the
reverents. Regarded objectively, it is,in the first place,just
possible that they are mistaken concerning the extent of their debt to
Christianity: a man's convictions prove nothing concerning the thing
he is convinced about, and in religions they are more likely to give
rise to suspicions.... Secondly, it is possible that the debt owing
to Christianity is not due to its Founder at all, but to the whole
structure, thewhole thing—to the Church, etc. The notion "Founder"
is so very equivocal, that it may stand even for the accidental
cause of a movement: the person of the Founder has been inflated in
proportion as the Church has grown: but even this process of veneration
allows of the conclusion that, at one time or other, this Founder was
something exceedingly insecure and doubtful—in the beginning.... Let
any one think of thefree and easy wayin which Paul treats the
problem of the personality of Jesus, how he almost juggles with it:
some one who died, who was seen after His death,—some one whom the
Jews delivered up to death—all this was only the theme—Paulwrote
the music to it.178.The founder of a religionmaybe quite insignificant—a wax vesta and
nomore!179.Concerning the psychological problem of Christianity.—The driving
forces are: resentment, popular insurrection, the revolt of the
bungled and the botched. (In Buddhism it is different: it is notbornofresentment.It rather combats resentment because the latter leads
toaction!)This party, which stands for freedom, understands that theabandonment
of antagonism in thought and deedis a condition of distinction and
preservation. Here lies the psychological difficulty which has stood in
the way of Christianity beingunderstood: the force which created it,
urges to a struggle against itself.Only as a party standingfor peaceandinnocencecan this
insurrectionary movement hope to be successful: it must conquer by
means of excessive mildness, sweetness, softness, and its instincts
are aware of this. Thefeatwas to deny and condemn the force, of
which man is the expression, and to press the reverse of that force
continually to the fore, by word and deed.180.The pretence of youthfulness.—It is a mistake to imagine that,
with Christianity, an ingenuous and youthful people rose against an
old culture; the story goes that it was out of the lowest levels of
society, where Christianity flourished and shot its roots, that the
more profound source of life gushed forth afresh: but nothing can
be understood of the psychology of Christianity, if it be supposed
that it was the expression of revived youth among a people, or of
the resuscitated strength of a race. It is rather a typical form
of decadence, of moral-softening and of hysteria, amid a general
hotch-potch of races and people that had lost all aims and had grown
weary and sick. The wonderful company which gathered round this
master-seducer of the populace, would not be at all out of place in a
Russian novel: all the diseases of the nerves seem to give one another
a rendezvous in this crowd—the absence of a known duty, the feeling
thateverything is nearing its end, that nothing is any longer worth
while, and that contentment lies indolce far niente.The power and certainty of the future in the Jew's instinct, its
monstrous will for life and for power, lies in its ruling classes; the
people who upheld primitive Christianity are best distinguished by thisexhausted conditionof their instincts. On the one hand, they are
sick of everything; on the other, they are content with each other,
with themselves and for themselves.181.Christianity regarded asemancipated Judaism(just as a nobility
which is both racial and indigenous ultimately emancipates itself from
these conditions, andgoes in search ofkindred elements....).(1) As a Church (community) on the territory of the State, as an
unpolitical institution.(2) As life, breeding, practice, art of living.(3) As areligion of sin(sin committed againstGod, being the
only recognised kind,and the only cause of all suffering), with a
universal cure for it. There is no sin save against God; what is done
against men, man shall not sit in judgment upon, nor call to account,
except in the name of God. At the same time, all commandments (love):
everything is associated with God, and all acts are performed according
to God's will. Beneath this arrangement there lies exceptional
intelligence (a very narrow life, such as that led by the Esquimaux,can only be endured by most peaceful and indulgent people: the
Judæo-Christian dogma turns against sin in favour of the "sinner").182.The Jewish priesthood understood how to present everything it claimed
to be right as adivine precept,as an act of obedience to God, and
also to introduce all those things which conduced topreserve Israeland were theconditionsof its existence (for instance: the large
number of "works": circumcision and the cult of sacrifices, as the
very pivot of the national conscience), not as Nature, but as God.This process continued; within the very heartof Judaism, where the
need of these "works" was not felt (that is to say, as a means of
keeping a race distinct), a priestly sort of man was pictured, whose
bearing towards the aristocracy was like that of "noble nature"; a
sacerdotalism of the soul, which now, in order to throw its opposite
into strong relief, attaches value, not to the "dutiful acts"
themselves, but to the sentiment....At bottom, the problem was once again, how to make a certain kind of
soulprevail: it was alsoa popular insurrection in the midst of
a priestly people—a pietistic movement coming from below (sinners,
publicans, women, and children). Jesus of Nazareth was the symbol of
their sect. And again, in order to believe in themselves, they were in
need of atheological transfiguration: they require nothing less than
"the Son of God" inorder to create a belief for themselves. And just
as the priesthood had falsified the whole history of Israel, another
attempt was made, here, toalter and falsifythe whole history of
mankind in such a way as to make Christianity seem like the most
important event it contained. This movement could have originated only
upon the soil of Judaism, the main feature of which was the confounding
ofguilt with sorrowand the reduction of allsintosin against
God.Of all this, Christianity is thesecond degree of power.183.The symbolism of Christianity is based upon that ofJudaism,which
had already transfigured all reality (history, Nature) into a holy and
artificial unreality—which refused to recognise real history, and
which showed no more interest in a natural course of things.184.The Jews made the attempt to prevail, after two of their castes—the
warrior and the agricultural castes, had disappeared from their midst.In this sense they are the "castrated people": they have their priests
and then—their Chandala....How easily a disturbance occurs among them—an insurrection of their
Chandala. This was the origin ofChristianity.Owing to the fact that they had no knowledge of warriors except as
their masters, they introducedenmity towards the nobles, the men
of honour, pride, and power, and therulingclasses, into their
religion: they are pessimists fromindignation....Thus they created a very important and novel position: the priests in
the van of the Chandala—against thenoble classes....Christianity was the logical conclusion of this movement: even in the
Jewish priesthood, it still scented the existence of the caste, of the
privileged and noble minority—it therefore did away with priests.Christ is the unit of the Chandala who removes the priest ... the
Chandala who redeems himself....That is why theFrenchRevolution is the lineal descendant and the
continuator ofChristianity—it is characterised by an instinct of
hate towards castes, nobles, and the last privileges.185.The "Christian Ideal" put on the stage with Jewish astuteness—these
are the fundamentalpsychological forcesof its "nature":—Revolt against the ruling spiritual powers;The attempt to make those virtues which facilitate thehappiness of
the lowly,a standard of all values—in fact, to callGodthat which
is no more than the self-preservative instinct of that class of man
possessed of least vitality;Obedience and absoluteabstentionfrom war and resistance, justified
by this ideal;The love of one another as a result of the love of God.The trick: Thedenialof allnatural mobilia,and their
transference to the spiritual world beyond ... the exploitation ofvirtueand itsvenerationfor wholly interested motives, gradualdenialof virtue in everything that is not Christian.186.Theprofound contemptwith which the Christian was treated by
the noble people of antiquity, is of the same order as the present
instinctive aversion to Jews: it is the hatred which free and
self-respecting classes feel towards thosewho wish to creep
in secretly,and who combine an awkward bearing with foolish
self-sufficiency.The New Testament is the gospel of a completelyignoblespecies of
man; its pretensions to highest values—yea, to allvalues, is, as a
matter of fact, revolting—even nowadays.187.How little the subject matters! It is the spirit which gives the thing
life! What a quantity of stuffy and sick-room air there is in all that
chatter about "redemption," "love," "blessedness," "faith," "truth,"
"eternal life"! Let any one look into a really pagan book and compare
the two; for instance, in Petronius, nothing at all is done, said,
desired, and valued, which, according to a bigoted Christian estimate,
is not sin, or even deadly sin. And yet how happy one feels with the
purer air, thesuperior intellectuality, the quicker pace, and the
free overflowing strength which is certain of the future! In the whole
of the New Testament there is not onebouffonnerie: but that fact
alone would suffice to refute any book....188.Theprofound lack of dignitywith which all life, which is not
Christian, is condemned: it does not suffice them to think meanly of
their actual opponents, they cannot do with less than a general slander
of everything that is notthemselves....An abject and crafty soul is
in the most perfect harmony with the arrogance of piety, as witness the
early Christians.Thefuture: they see thatthey are heavily paid for it.... Theirs is
the muddiest kind of spirit that exists.The whole of Christ's life is
so arranged as to confirm the prophecies of the Scriptures: He behaves
in such wisein order thatthey may be right....189.The deceptive interpretation of the words, the doings, and the
condition ofdying people; the natural fear of death, for instance,
is systematically confounded with the supposed fear of what is to
happen "after death." ...190.TheChristianshave done exactly what the Jews did before them.
They introduced what theyconceived to be an innovation and a thing
necessary to self-preservation into their Master's teaching, and wove
His life into it They likewise credited Him with all the wisdom of a
maker of proverbs—in short,they represented their everyday life and
activity as an act of obedience, and thus sanctified their propaganda.What it all depends upon, may be gathered from Paul: it isnot much.What remains is the development of a type of saint, out of the values
which these people regarded as saintly.The whole of the "doctrine of miracles," including the resurrection, is
the result of self-glorification on the part of the community, which
ascribed to its Master those qualities it ascribed to itself, but in a
higher degree (or, better still, it derived its strength from Him....)191.The Christians have never led the life which Jesus commanded them to
lead, and the impudent fable of the "justification by faith," and its
unique and transcendental significance, is only the result of the
Church's lack of courage and will in acknowledging those "works"
which Jesus commanded.The Buddhist behaves differently from the non-Buddhist; butthe
Christian behaves as all the rest of the world does,and possesses a
Christianity of ceremonies andstates of the soul.The profound and contemptible falsehood of Christianity in Europe makes
us deserve the contempt of the Arabs, Hindoos, and Chinese....Let any one listen to the words of the first German statesman,
concerning that which has preoccupied Europe for the last forty years.192."Faith" or "works"?—But that the "works," the habit of particular
works may engender a certainset of values or thoughts,is just as
natural as it would be unnatural for "works" to proceed from mere
valuations. Man must practise,nothow to strengthen feelings of
value, but how to strengthen action: first of all, one must be ableto do something....Luther's Christian Dilettantism. Faith is an
asses' bridge. The background consists of a profound conviction on
the part of Luther and his peers, that they are enabled to accomplish
Christian "works," a personal fact, disguised under an extreme doubt
as to whetherallaction is not sin and devil's work, so that the
worth of life depends upon isolated and highly-strained conditions ofinactivity(prayer, effusion, etc.).—Ultimately, Luther would be
right: the instincts which are expressed by the whole bearing of the
reformers are the most brutal that exist. Only inturning absolutely
awayfrom themselves, and in becoming absorbed in theoppositeof
themselves, only by means of anillusion("faith") was existence
endurable to them.193."What was to be done in order to believe?"—an absurd question. That
which is wrong withChristianity is, that it does none of the things
that Christcommanded.It is a mean life, butseenthrough the eye of contempt.194.The entrance into thereallife—a man saves his own life by living
the life of the multitude.195.Christianity has become something fundamentally different from what
its Founder wished it to be. It is the greatanti-pagan movementof
antiquity, formulated with the use of the life, teaching, and "words"
of the Founder of Christianity, but interpreted quitearbitrarily,according to a scheme embodyingprofoundly different needs:
translated into the language of all thesubterranean religionsthen
existing.It is the rise of Pessimism (whereas Jesus wished to bring the peace
and the happiness of the lambs): and moreover the Pessimism of the
weak, of the inferior, of the suffering, and of the oppressed.Its mortal enemies are (1)Power,whether in the form of character,
intellect, or taste, and "worldliness"; (2) the "good cheer" of
classical times, the noble levity and scepticism, hard pride, eccentric
dissipation, and cold frugality of the sage, Greek refinement in
manners, words, and form. Its mortal enemy is as much theRomanas
theGreek.The attempt on the part ofanti-paganismto establish itself on
a philosophical basis, and to make its tenets possible: it shows a
taste for the ambiguous figures of antique culture, and above all for
Plato, who was, more than any other, an anti-Hellene and Semite in
instinct.... It also shows a taste for Stoicism, which is essentially
the work of Semites ("dignity" is regarded as severity, law; virtue
is held to be greatness, self-responsibility, authority, greatest
sovereignty over oneself—this is Semitic.) The Stoic is an Arabian
sheik wrapped in Greek togas and notions.196.Christianity only resumes the fight which had already been begun
against theclassicalideal andnoblereligion.As a matter of fact, the whole process oftransformationis only
an adaptation to the needs and to the level of intelligence ofreligiousmasses then existing:—those masses which believed in
Isis, Mithras, Dionysos, and the "great mother," and which demanded
the following things of a religion: (1) hopes of a beyond, (2) the
bloody phantasmagoria of animal sacrifice (the mystery), (3) holy
legend and the redeemingdeed,(4) asceticism, denial of the
world, superstitious "purification," (5) a hierarchy as a part of
the community. In short, Christianity everywhere fitted the already
prevailing and increasinganti-pagan tendency—those cults which
Epicurus combated,—or more exactly, thosereligions proper to the
lower herd, women, slaves, and ignoble classes.The misunderstandings are therefore the following:—(1) The immortality of the individual;(2) The assumed existence ofanotherworld;(3) The absurd notion of punishment and expiation in the heart of the
interpretation of existence;(4) The profanation of the divine nature of man, instead of its
accentuation, and the construction of a very profound chasm, which
can only be crossed by the help of a miracle or by means of the most
thorough self-contempt;(5) The whole world of corrupted imagination and morbid passion,
instead of a simple and loving life of action, instead of Buddhistic
happiness attainable on earth;(6) An ecclesiastical order with a priesthood, theology, cults, and
sacraments; in short, everything that Jesus of Nazarethcombated;(7) Themiraculousin everything and everybody, superstition too:
while precisely the trait which distinguished Judaism and primitive
Christianity was theirrepugnance tomiracles and their relativerationalism.197.The psychological pre-requisites:—Ignoranceandlack of
culture,—the sort of ignorance which has unlearned every kind of
shame: let any one imagine those impudent saints in the heart of
Athens;TheJewish instinct of a chosen people: they appropriateall the
virtues,without further ado, as their own, and regard the rest of
the world as their opposite; this is a profound sign ofspiritual
depravity;The total lack of real aimsand realduties,for which other
virtues are required than those of the bigot—the State undertook
this work for them: and the impudent people still behaved as though
they had no need of the State. "Except ye become as little children"
—oh, how far we are from this psychological ingenuousness!198.The Founder of Christianity had to pay dearly for having directed His
teaching at the lowest classes of Jewish society and intelligence. They
understood Him only according to the limitations of their own spirit.
... It was a disgrace to concoct a history of salvation, a personal
God, a personal Saviour, a personal immortality, and to have retained
all the meanness of the "person," and of the "history" of a doctrine
which denies the reality of all that is personal and historical.The legend of salvation takes the place of the symbolic "now" and "all
time," of the symbolic "here" and "everywhere"; and miracles appear
instead of the psychological symbol.199.Nothing is less innocent than the New Testament. The soil from which it
sprang is known.These people, possessed of an inflexible will to assert themselves, and
who, once they had lost all natural hold on life, and had long existed
without any right to existence, still knew how to prevail by means of
hypotheses which were as unnatural as they were imaginary (calling
themselves the chosen people, the community of saints, the people of
the promised land, and the "Church"): these people made use of theirpia frauswith such skill, and with such "clean consciences," that
one cannot be too cautious when they preach morality. When Jews step
forward as the personification of innocence, the danger must be great.
While reading the New Testament a man should have his small fund of
intelligence, mistrust, and wickedness constantly at hand.People of the lowest origin, partly mob, outcasts not only from good
society, but also from respectable society; grown away from theatmosphereof culture, and free from discipline; ignorant, without
even a suspicion of the fact that conscience can also rule in spiritual
matters; in a word—the Jews: an instinctively crafty people, able to
create an advantage, a means ofseductionout of every conceivable
hypothesis of superstition, even out of ignorance itself.200.I regard Christianity as the most fatal and seductive lie that has ever
yet existed—as the greatest and mostimpious lie: I can discern thelast sprouts and branches of its ideal beneath every form of disguise,
I decline to enter into any compromise or false position in reference
to it—I urge people to declare open war with it.Themorality of paltry peopleas the measure of all things: this is
the most repugnant kind of degeneracy that civilisation has ever yet
brought into existence. And thiskind of idealis hanging still,
under the name of "God," over men's heads!!201.However modest one's demands may be concerning intellectual
cleanliness, when one touches the New Testament one cannot help
experiencing a sort of inexpressible feeling of discomfort; for the
unbounded cheek with which the least qualified people will have their
say in its pages, in regard to the greatest problems of existence,
and claim to sit in judgment on such matters, exceeds all limits. The
impudent levity with which the most unwieldy problems are spoken of
here (life, the world, God, the purpose of life), as if they were not
problems at all, but the most simple things which these little bigotsknow all about!!!202.This was the most fatal form of insanity that has ever yet existed on
earth:—when these little lying abortions of bigotry begin laying claim
to the words "God," "last judgment," "truth,""love," "wisdom," "Holy
Spirit," and thereby distinguishing themselves from the rest of the
world; when such men begin to transvalue values to suit themselves, as
though they were the sense, the salt, the standard, and the measure of
all things; then all that one should do is this: build lunatic asylums
for their incarceration. Topersecutethem was an egregious act of
antique folly: this was taking them too seriously; it was making them
serious.The whole fatality was made possible by the fact that a similar form
of megalomania was alreadyin existence,theJewishform (once
the gulf separating the Jews from the Christian-Jews was bridged, the
Christian-Jewswere compelledto employ those self-preservative
measures afresh which were discovered by the Jewish instinct, for
their own self-preservation, after having accentuated them); and again
through the fact that Greek moral philosophy had done everything that
could be done to prepare the way for moral-fanaticism, even among
Greeks and Romans, and to render it palatable.... Plato, the great
importer of corruption, who was the first who refused to see Nature
in morality, and who had already deprived the Greek gods of all their
worth by his notion "good" was already tainted withJewish bigotry(in Egypt?).203.These small virtues of gregarious animals do not by any means lead
to "eternal life": to putthem on the stage in such a way, and to
use them for one's own purpose is perhaps very smart; but to him who
keeps his eyes open, even here, it remains, in spite of all, the most
ludicrous performance. A man by no means deserves privileges, either on
earth or in heaven, because he happens to have attained to perfection
in the art of behaving like a good-natured little sheep; at best, he
only remains a dear, absurd little ram with horns—provided, of course,
he does not burst with vanity or excite indignation by assuming the
airs of a supreme judge.What a terrible glow of false colouring here floods the meanest
virtues—as though they were the reflection of divine qualities!Thenaturalpurpose and utility of every virtue is systematicallyhushed up; it can only be valuable in the light of adivinecommand
or model, or in the light of the good which belongs to a beyond or a
spiritual world. (This is magnificent!—As if it were a question of thesalvation of the soul: but it was a means of making things bearable
here with as many beautiful sentiments as possible.)204.Thelaw,which is the fundamentally realistic formula of certain
self-preservative measures of a community, forbids certain actions
that have a definite tendency to jeopardise the welfare of that
community: it doesnotforbid the attitude of mind which gives rise
to these actions—for in thepursuit of other ends the community
requires these forbidden actions, namely, when it is a matter of
opposing itsenemies.The moral idealist now steps forward and says:
"God sees into men's hearts: the action itself counts for nothing;
the reprehensible attitude of mind from which it proceeds must be
extirpated ..." In normal conditions men laugh at such things; it is
only in exceptional cases, when a community livesquitebeyond the
need of waging war in order to maintain itself, that an ear is lent to
such things. Any attitude of mind is abandoned, the utility of which
cannot be conceived.This was the case, for example, when Buddha appeared among a people
that was both peaceable and afflicted with great intellectual weariness.
