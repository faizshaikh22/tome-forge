"Un monstre gai vaut mieuxQu'un sentimental ennuyeux."If now I maintain that I am ahead, by a century or two of
enlightenment, of Voltaire and Galiani—who was much more profound, how
deeply must I have sunk into gloominess! This is also true, and betimes
I somewhat reluctantly manifested some caution in regard to the German
and Christian narrowness and inconsistency of Schopenhauerian or, worse
still, Leopardian Pessimism, and sought the most characteristic form
(Asia). But, in order to endure that extreme Pessimism (which here and
there peeps out of myBirth of Tragedy),to live alone "without God
or morality,"I was compelled to invent a counter-prop for myself.
Perhaps I know best why man is the only animal that laughs: he alone
surfers so excruciatingly that he wascompelledto invent laughter.
The unhappiest and most melancholy animal is, as might have been
expected, the most cheerful.92.In regard to German culture, I have always had a feeling as ofdecline.The fact that I learned to know a declining form of culture
has often made meunfairtowards the whole phenomenon of European
culture. The Germans always follow at some distance behind: they always
go to the root of things, for instance:—Dependance upon foreigners;Kant—Rousseau, the sensualists, Hume,
Swedenborg.Schopenhauer—the Indians and Romanticism, Voltaire.Wagner—the French cult of the ugly and of grand opera,Paris,and
the flight intoprimitive barbarism(the marriage of brother and
sister).The law of thelaggard(the provinces go to Paris, Germany goes to
France).How is it that preciselyGermans discovered the Greek(the more an
instinct is developed, the more it istemptedto run for once into
its opposite).Music is the last breath of every culture.93.Renaissance and Reformation.—What does the Renaissance prove? That
the reign of the"individual" can be only a short one. The output
is too great; there is not even the possibility of husbanding or of
capitalising forces, and exhaustion sets in step by step. These are
times when everything issquandered,when even the strength itself
with which one collects, capitalises, and heaps riches upon riches,is squandered.Even the opponents of such movements are driven to
preposterous extremes in the dissipation of their strength: and they
too are very soon exhausted, used up, and completely sapped.In the Reformation we are face to face with a wild and plebeian
counterpart of the Italian Renaissance, generated by similar impulses,
except that the former, in the backward and still vulgar North, had to
assume a religious form—there the concept of a higher life had not yet
been divorced from that of a religious one.Even the Reformation was a movement for individual liberty; "every one
his own priest" is really no more than a formula forlibertinage.As a matter of fact, the words "Evangelical freedom" would have
sufficed—and all instincts which had reasons for remaining concealed
broke out like wild hounds, the most brutal needs suddenly acquired the
courage to show themselves, everything seemed justified ... men refused
to specify the kind of freedom they had aimed at, they preferred to
shut their eyes. But the fact that their eyes were closed and that
their lips were moistened with gushing orations, did not prevent their
hands from being ready to snatch at whatever there was to snatch at,
that the belly became the god of the"free gospel," and that all lusts
of revenge and of hatred were indulged with insatiable fury.This lasted for a while: then exhaustion supervened, just as it
had done in Southern Europe; and again here, it was a low form of
exhaustion, a sort of generalruere in servitium.... Then thedisreputablecentury of Germany dawned.94.Chivalry—the position won by power: its gradual break-up (and
partial transference to broader and more bourgeois spheres). In the
case of Larochefoucauld we find a knowledge of the actual impulses of a
noble temperament—together with the gloomy Christian estimate of these
impulses.Theprotraction of Christianitythrough theFrench Revolution.The
seducer is Rousseau; he once again liberates woman, who thenceforward
is always represented as ever more interesting—suffering.Then come
the slaves and Mrs. Beecher-Stowe. Then the poor and the workmen.
Then the vicious and the sick—all this is drawn into the foreground
(even for the purpose of disposing people in favour of the genius,
it has been customary for five hundred years to press him forward as
the great sufferer!). Then comes the cursing of all voluptuousness
(Baudelaire and Schopenhauer), the most decided conviction that the
lust of power is the greatest vice; absolute certainty that morality
and disinterestedness are identical things; that the "happiness of all"
is a goal worthstriving after (i.e.,Christ's Kingdom of Heaven).
We are on the best road to it: the Kingdom of Heaven of the poor in
spirit has begun.—Intermediate stages: the bourgeois (as a result of
thenouveau riche) and the workman (as a result of the machine).Greek and French culture of the time of Louis XIV. compared. A decided
belief in oneself. A leisure-class which makes things hard for itself
and exercises a great deal of self-control. The power of form, the will
to formoneself."Happiness" acknowledged as a purpose. Much strength
and energybehindall formality of manners. Pleasure at the sight of
a life that isseemingly so easy.TheGreeksseemed likechildrento the French.95.The Three Centuries.Their different kinds ofsensitivenessmay perhaps be best expressed
as follows:—Aristocracy: Descartes, the reign ofreason,evidence showing the
sovereignty of thewill.Feminism: Rousseau, the reign offeeling,evidence showing the
sovereignty of the senses; all lies.Animalism: Schopenhauer, the reign ofpassion,evidence showing the
sovereignty of animality, more honest, but gloomy.The seventeenth century isaristocratic,all for order, haughty
towards everything animal, severe in regard to the heart, "austere,"
and even free from sentiment, "non-German," averse to all that isburlesque and natural, generalising and maintaining an attitude of
sovereignty towards the past for it believes in itself. At bottom it
partakes very much of the beast of prey, and practises asceticism in
order to remain master. It is the century of strength of will, as also
that of strong passion.The eighteenth century is dominated bywoman,it is gushing,
spiritual, and flat; but with intellect at the service of aspirations
and of the heart, it is a libertine in the pleasures of intellect,
undermining all authorities; emotionally intoxicated, cheerful, clear,
humane, and sociable, false to itself and at bottom very rascally....The nineteenth century is moreanimal,more subterranean, hateful,
realistic, plebeian, and on that very account "better," "more honest,"
more submissive to "reality" of what kind soever, andtruer; but
weak of will, sad, obscurely exacting and fatalistic. It has no
feeling of timidity or reverence, either in the presence of "reason"
or the "heart"; thoroughly convinced of the dominion of the desires
(Schopenhauer said "Will," but nothing is more characteristic of his
philosophy than that it entirely lacks all actualwilling). Even
morality is reduced to an instinct ("Pity").Auguste Comte isthe continuation of theeighteenthcentury(the
dominion of the heart over the head, sensuality in the theory of
knowledge, altruistic exaltation).The fact thatsciencehas become as sovereign as it is to-day, proves
how the nineteenth century hasemancipated itselffrom the dominion
ofideals.A certain absence of "needs" and wishes makes our
scientific curiosity and rigour possible—this is our kind of virtue.Romanticism is thecounterstrokeof the eighteenth century; a sort of
accumulated longing for its grand style of exaltation (as a matter of
fact, largely mingled with mummery and self-deception: the desire was
to representstrong natureandstrong passion).The nineteenth century instinctively goes in search oftheoriesby means of which it may feel itsfatalistic, submission to the
empire of factsjustified. Hegel's success against sentimentality
and romantic idealism was already a sign of its fatalistic trend of
thought, in its belief that superior reason belongs to the triumphant
side, and in its justification of the actual "state" (in the place of
"humanity," etc.).—Schopenhauer: we are something foolish, and at the
best self-suppressive. The success of determinism, the genealogical
derivation ofobligationswhich were formerly held to be absolute,
the teaching of environment and adaptation, the reduction of will to
a process of reflex movement, the denial of the will as a "working
cause"; finally—a real process of re-christening: so little will
is observed that the word itself becomesavailablefor another
purpose. Further theories: the teaching ofobjectivity,"will-less"
contemplation, as the only road to truth,as alsotobeauty(also
the belief in "genius," in order to havethe right to be submissive);
mechanism, the determinable rigidity of the mechanical process;
so-called "Naturalism,"the elimination of the choosing, directing,
interpreting subject, on principle.Kant, with his "practical reason," with hismoral fanaticism,is
quite eighteenth century style; still completely outside the historical
movement, without any notion whatsoever of the reality of his time, for
instance, revolution; he is not affected by Greek philosophy; he is a
phantasist of the notion of duty, a sensualist with a hidden leaning to
dogmatic pampering.The return to Kantin our century means areturn to the eighteenth
century,people desire to create themselves a right to theold ideasand to the old exaltation—hence a theory of knowledge which "describes
limits," that is to say, which admitsof the option of fixing a Beyond
to the domain of reason.Hegel'sway of thinking is not so very far removed from that of
Goethe: see the latter on the subject of Spinoza, for instance.
The will to deify the All and Life, in order to find bothpeaceandhappinessin contemplating them: Hegel looks for reason
everywhere—in the presence of reason man may besubmissiveand
resigned. In Goethe we find a kind offatalismwhich is almostjoyousandconfiding,which neither revolts nor weakens, which
strives to make a totality out of itself, in the belief that only in
totality does everything seem good and justified, and find itself
resolved.96.The period ofrationalism—followed by a period ofsentimentality.To what extent doesSchopenhauer come under "sentimentality"? (Hegel
under intellectuality?)97.The seventeenth centurysuffersfromhumanityas from ahost
of contradictions("l'amas de contradictions" that we are); it
endeavours to discover man, toco-ordinate him,to excavate him:
whereas the eighteenth century tries to forget what is known of man's
nature, in order to adapt him to its Utopia. "Superficial, soft,
humane"—gushes over "humanity."The seventeenth century tries to banish all traces of the individual
in order that the artist's work may resemble life as much as possible.
The eighteenth century strivesto create interest in the authorby
means of the work. The seventeenth century seeks art in art, a piece of
culture; the eighteenth uses art in its propaganda for political and
social reforms."Utopia," the "ideal man," the deification of Nature, the vanity of
making one's own personality the centre of interest, subordination to
the propaganda ofsocial ideas,charlatanism—all this we derive from
the eighteenth century.The style of the seventeenth century:propre exact et libre.The strong individual who is self-sufficient, or who appeals
ardently to God—and that obtrusiveness and indiscretion of modern
authors—these things areopposites."Showing-oneself-off"—what a
contrast to the Scholars of Port-Royal!Alfieri had a sense for thegrand style.The hate of theburlesque(that which lacks dignity),the lack of a
sense of Naturebelongs to the seventeenth century.98.Against Rousseau.—Alas!man is no longer sufficiently evil;
Rousseau's opponents, who say that "man is a beast of prey," are
unfortunately wrong. Not the corruption of man, but the softening and
moralising of him is the curse. In the sphere which Rousseau attacked
most violently, therelativelystrongest and most successful type of
man was still to be found (the type which still possessed the great
passions intact: Will to Power, Will to Pleasure, the Will and Ability
to Command). The man of the eighteenth century must be compared with
the man of the Renaissance (also with the man of the seventeenth
century in France) if the matter is to be understood at all: Rousseau
is a symptom of self-contempt and of inflamed vanity—both signs that
the dominating will is lacking: he moralises and seeks thecauseof
his own misery after the style of a revengeful man in therulingclasses.99.Voltaire—Rousseau.—A state of nature is terrible; man is a beast of
prey: our civilisation is an extraordinarytriumphover this beast of
prey in nature—this wasVoltairesconclusion. He was conscious of
the mildness, the refinements,the intellectual joys of the civilised
state; he despised obtuseness, even in the form of virtue, and the lack
of delicacy even in ascetics and monks.Themoral depravityof man seemed to pre-occupyRousseau; the words
"unjust," "cruel," are the best possible for the purpose of exciting
the instincts of the oppressed, who otherwise find themselves under
the ban of thevetitumand of disgrace;so that their conscience
is opposed to their indulging any insurrectional desires.These
emancipators seek one thing above all: to give their party the great
accents and attitudes ofhigher Nature.100.Rousseau; the rule founded on sentiment; Nature as the source of
justice; man perfects himself in proportion as he approachesNature(according to Voltaire, in proportionas he leaves Nature behind).
The very same periods seem to the one to demonstrate the progress ofhumanityand, to the other, the increase of injustice and inequality.Voltaire, who still understoodumanitàin the sense of the
Renaissance, as alsovirtù(as "higher culture"), fights for the
cause of the "honnêtes gens" "la bonne compagnie" taste, science,
arts, and even for the cause of progress and civilisation.The flare-up occurred towards 1760: On the one hand the citizen
of Geneva, on the otherle seigneur de Ferney.It is only from
that moment and henceforward that Voltaire was the man ofhis age,
the philosopher, the representative of Toleration and of Disbelief
(theretofore he had been merelyun bel esprit). His envy and hatred
of Rousseau's success forced him upwards."Pour 'la canaille' un dieu rémunérateur et vengeur"—Voltaire.The criticism of both standpoints in regard to thevalue of
civilisation.To Voltaire nothing seems finer than thesocial
invention: there is no higher goal than to uphold and perfect it.L'honnêtetéconsists precisely in respecting social usage; virtue
in a certain obedience towards various necessary "prejudices" which
favour the maintenance of society.Missionary of Culture,aristocrat,
representative of the triumphant and ruling classes and their values.
But Rousseau remained aplebeian,even ashommes de lettres,this
waspreposterous; his shameless contempt for everything that was not
himself.Themorbid featurein Rousseau is the one which happens to have been
most admired andimitated.(Lord Byron resembled him somewhat, he
too screwed himself up to sublime attitudes and to revengeful rage—a
sign of vulgarity; later on, when Venice restored his equilibrium,
he understood whatalleviates mostand does themost good ...
l'insouciance.)In spite of his antecedents, Rousseau is proud of himself; but he is
incensed if he is reminded of his origin....In Rousseau there was undoubtedly some brain trouble; in Voltaire—rare
health and lightsomeness.The revengefulness of the sick; his
periodsof insanity as also those of his contempt of man, and of his
mistrust.Rousseau's defence ofProvidence(against Voltaire's Pessimism):
hehad need ofGod in order to be able to curse society and
civilisation; everything must be goodper se,because God had created
it; manalone has corrupted man.The "good man" as a man of Nature
was pure fantasy; but with the dogma of God's authorship he became
something probable and even not devoid of foundation.Romanticismà laRousseau: passion ("the sovereign right of
passion"); "naturalness"; the fascination of madness (foolishness
reckoned as greatness); the senseless vanity of the weak; the
revengefulness of the masses elevated to the position ofjustice("in politics, for one hundred years, the leader has always been this
invalid").101.Kant: makes the scepticism of Englishmen, in regard to the theory of
knowledge,possiblefor Germans.(1) By enlisting in its cause the interest of the German's religious
and moral needs: just as the new academicians used scepticism for the
same reasons, as a preparation for Platonism (videAugustine); just
as Pascal even usedmoralscepticism in order to provoke (to justify)
the need of belief;(2) By complicating and entangling it with scholastic flourishes in
view of making it moreacceptable to the German's scientific taste in
form (for Locke and Hume, alone, were too illuminating, too clear—that
is to say, judged according to the German valuing instinct, "too
superficial").Kant: a poor psychologist and mediocre judge of human nature, made
hopeless mistakes in regard to great historical values (the French
Revolution); a moral fanaticà laRousseau; with a subterranean
current of Christian values; a thorough dogmatist, but bored to
extinction by this tendency, to the extent of wishing to tyrannise
over it, but quickly tired, even of 'scepticism; and not yet affected
by any cosmopolitan thought or antique beauty ... adawdlerand ago-between,not at all original (likeLeibnitz,something between
mechanism and spiritualism; likeGoethe,something between the taste
of the eighteenth century and that of the "historical sense" [whichisessentially a sense of exoticism]; likeGerman music,between
French and Italian music; like Charles the Great, who mediated and
built bridges between the Roman Empire and Nationalism—a dawdlerpar
excellence).102.In what respect have theChristiancenturies with their Pessimism
beenstrongercenturies than the eighteenth—and how do they
correspond with thetragicage of the Greeks?The nineteenth centuryversusthe eighteenth. How was it an
heir?—how was it a step backwards from the latter? (more lacking in
"spirit" andin taste)—how did it show an advance on the latter?
(more gloomy, more realistic,stronger).103.How can weexplainthe fact that we feel something in common with theCampagna romana?And the high mountain chain?Chateaubriand in a letter to M. de Fontanes in 1803 writes his first
impression of theCampagna romana.The President de Brosses says of theCampagna romana: "Il fallait
que Romulus fût ivre quand il songea à bâtir une ville dans un terrain
aussi laid."Even Delacroix would have nothing to do with Rome, it frightened him.
He loved Venice, just as Shakespeare, Byron, and Georges Sand did.
Théophile Gautier's and Richard Wagner's dislike of Rome must not be
forgotten.Lamartine has the language for Sorrento and Posilippo.Victor Hugo raves about Spain, "parce que aucune autre nation n'a
moins emprunté à l'antiquité, parce qu'elle n'a subi aucune influence
classique."104.Thetwo great attemptsthat were made to overcome the eighteenth
century:Napoleon,in that he called man, the soldier, and the great struggle
for power, to life again, and conceived Europe as a political power.Goethe,in that he imagined a European culturewhich would consist
of the whole heritage of what humanity hadattained toup to his time.German culture in this century inspires mistrust—the music of the
period lacks that complete element which liberates and binds as well,
to wit—Goethe.The pre-eminence ofmusicin the romanticists of 1830 and 1840.
Delacroix. Ingres—a passionate musician (admired Gluck, Haydn,
Beethoven, Mozart), said to his pupils in Rome: "Si je pouvais vous
rendre tous musiciens, vous y gagneriez comme peintres"—likewise
Horace Vernet, who was particularly fond of Don Juan (as Mendelssohn
assures us, 1831); Stendhal, too, who says of himself: "Combien de
lieues ne ferais-je pas à pied, et à combien de jours de prison ne me
soumetterais-je pas pour entendreDon Juan ou le Matrimonio segreto;
et je ne sais pour quelle autre chose je ferais cet effort." He was
then fifty-six years old.The borrowed forms, for instance: Brahms as a typical "Epigone,"
likewise Mendelssohn's cultured Protestantism (a former "soul" is
turned into poetry posthumously ...)—the moral and poetical substitutions in Wagner, who usedoneart as
a stop-gap to make up for what another lacked.—the "historical sense," inspiration derived from poems, sagas.—that characteristic transformation of which G. Flaubert is the most
striking example among Frenchmen, and Richard Wagner the most striking
example among Germans, shows how theromantic belief in love and the
future changes into a longing for nonentity in 1830-50.106.How is it that German music reaches its culminating point in the age of
German romanticism? How is it that German music lacks Goethe? On the
other hand, how much Schiller, or more exactly, how much "Thekla"[5]is
there not in Beethoven!Schumann has Eichendorff, Uhland, Heine, Hoffman, Tieck, in him.
Richard Wagner has Freischütz, Hoffmann, Grimm, the romantic Saga,
the mystic Catholicism of instinct, symbolism, "the free-spiritedness
of passion" (Rousseau's intention). TheFlying Dutchmansavours of
France, wherele ténébreux(1830) was the type of the seducer.The cult of music,the revolutionary romanticism of form. WagnersynthesisesGerman and French romanticism.[5]Thekla is the sentimental heroine in Schiller'sWallenstein.—TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.107.From the point of view only of his value to Germany and to German
culture, Richard Wagner is still a great problem, perhaps a German
misfortune: in any case, however, a fatality. But what does it
matter? Is he not very much more than a German event? It also
seems to me that to no country on earth is he less related than to
Germany; nothing was prepared there forhis advent; his whole type
is simply strange amongst Germans; there he stands in their midst,
wonderful, misunderstood, incomprehensible. But people carefully avoid
acknowledging this: they are too kind, too square-headed—too German
for that. "Credo quia absurdus est": thus did the German spirit wish
it to be, in this case too—hence it is content meanwhile to believe
everything Richard Wagner wanted to have believed about himself. In all
ages the spirit of Germany has been deficient in subtlety and divining
powers concerning psychological matters. Now that it happens to be
under the high pressure of patriotic nonsense and self-adoration, it is
visibly growing thicker and coarser: how could it therefore be equal to
the problem of Wagner!108.The Germansarenot yet anything, but they arebecomingsomething;
that is why they have not yet any culture;—that is why they cannot
yet have any culture!—They are not yet anything: that means they are
all kinds of things. They arebecomingsomething: that means that
they will one day cease from being all kinds of things. The latter is
at bottom only a wish, scarcely a hope yet. Fortunately it is a wish
with which one can live, a question of will, of work, of discipline, a
question of training, as also of resentment, of longing, of privation,
of discomfort,—yea, even of bitterness,—in short, we Germanswillget something out of ourselves, something that has not yet been wanted
of us—we want somethingmore!That this "German, as he is not as yet"—has a right to something
better than the present German "culture"; that all who wish to
become something better, must wax angry when they perceive a sort of
contentment, an impudent "setting-oneself-at-ease," or "a process of
self-censing," in this quarter: that is my second principle, in regard
to which my opinions have not yet changed.(c)Signs of Increasing Strength.109.First Principle: everything that characterises modern men savours of
decay: but side by side with the prevailing sickness there are signs of
a strength and powerfulness of soul which are still untried.The same
causes which tend to promote the belittling of men,also forcethe
stronger and rarer individuals upwards to greatness.110.General survey: the ambiguouscharacter of ourmodern
world—precisely the same symptoms might at the same time be
indicative of eitherdeclineorstrength.And the signs of strength
and of emancipation dearly bought, might in view of traditional
(orhereditary) appreciations concerned with the feelings, bemisunderstoodas indications of weakness. In short,feeling,as ameans of fixing valuations,is noton a level with the times.Generalised: Every valuation is alwaysbackward; it is merely the
expression of the conditions which favoured survival and growth in a
much earlier age: it struggles against new conditions of existence
out of which it did not arise, and which it therefore necessarily
misunderstands: it hinders, and excites suspicion against, all that is
new.111.The problem of the nineteenth century.—To discover whether its
strong and weak side belong to each other. Whether they have been cut
from one and the same piece. Whether the variety of its ideals and
their contradictions are conditioned by a higher purpose: whether
they are something higher.—For it might bethe prerequisite of
greatness,that growth should take place amid such violent tension.
Dissatisfaction, Nihilism,might be a good sign.112.General survey.—As a matter of fact, all abundant growth involves a
concomitant process ofcrumbling to bitsanddecay: suffering and
the symptoms of declinebelongto ages of enormous progress; every
fruitful and powerful movement of mankind has alwaysbrought abouta concurrent Nihilistic movement. Under certain circumstances, the
appearance ofthe extremestform of Pessimism and actualNihilismmight be the sign of a process of incisive and most essential growth,
and of mankind's transit into completely new conditions of existence.This is what I have understood.113.A.Starting out with a thoroughly courageousappreciationof our men of
to-day:—we must not allow ourselves to be deceived by appearance: this
mankind is much less effective, but it gives quite different pledges
oflasting strength,its tempo is slower, but the rhythm itself is
richer.Healthinessis increasing, the real conditions of a healthy
body are on the point of being known, and will gradually be created,
"asceticism" is regarded with irony. The fear of extremes, a certain
confidence in the "right way," no raving: a periodical self-habituation
to narrower values (such as "mother-land," "science," etc.).This whole picture, however, would still beambiguous: it might be a
movement either ofincreaseordeclinein Life.B.The belief in "progress"—in lower spheres of intelligence, appears as
increasing life: but this is self-deception;in higher spheres of intelligence it is a sign ofdeclininglife.Description of the symptoms.The unity of the aspect: uncertainty in regard to the standard of
valuation.Fear of a general "in vain."Nihilism.114.As a matter of fact, we are no longer so urgently in need of an
antidote against the first Nihilism: Life is no longer so uncertain,
accidental, and senseless in modern Europe. All such tremendousexaggerationof the value of men, of the value of evil, etc., are
not so necessary now; we can endure a considerable diminution of this
value, we may grant a great deal of nonsense and accident: thepowerman has acquired now allows of aloweringof the means of discipline,
of which the strongest was the moral interpretation of the universe.
The hypothesis "God" is much too extreme.115.If anything shows that ourhumanisationis a genuine sign ofprogress,it is the fact that we no longer require excessive
contraries, that we no longer require contraries at all....We may love the senses; for we have spiritualised them in every way and
made them artistic;We have a right to all things which hitherto have been mostcalumniated.116.The reversal of the order of rank.—Those pious counterfeiters—the
priests—are becoming Chandala in our midst:—they occupy the
position of the charlatan, of the quack, of the counterfeiter, of the
sorcerer: we regard them as corrupters of the will,as the great
slanderers and vindictive enemies of Life, and as therebelsamong
the bungled and the botched. We have made our middle class out of our
servant-caste—the Sudra—that is to say, our people or the body which
wields the political power.On the other hand, the Chandala of former times is paramount: theblasphemers,theimmoralists,the independents of all kinds, the
artists, the Jews, the minstrels—and, at bottom, alldisreputableclasses are in the van.We have elevated ourselves tohonourablethoughts,—even more, we
determine what honour is on earth,—"nobility." ... All of us to-day
areadvocates of life.—WeImmoralistsare to-day thestrongestpower: the other great powers are in need of us ... we re-create the
world in our own image.We have transferred the label "Chandala" to thepriests,thebackworldsmen,and to the deformedChristian societywhich has
become associated with these people, together with creatures of like
origin, the pessimists, Nihilists, romanticists of pity, criminals, and
men of vicious habits—the whole sphere in which the idea of "God" is
that ofSaviour....We are proud of being no longer obliged to be liars, slanderers, and
detractors of Life....117.The advanceof the nineteenth century upon the eighteenth (at bottom
wegood Europeansare carrying on a war against the eighteenth
century):(1) "The return to Nature" is getting to be understood, ever more
definitely, in a way which is quite the reverse of that in which
Rousseau used the phrase—away from idylls and operas!(2) Ever more decided, more anti-idealistic, more objective, more
fearless, more industrious, more temperate, more suspicious of sudden
changes,anti-revolutionary;(3) The question ofbodily healthis being pressed ever more
decidedly in front of the health of "the soul": the latter is regarded
as a condition brought about by the former, and bodily health is
believed to be, at least, the prerequisite to spiritual health.118.If anything at all has been achieved, it is a more innocent attitude
towards the senses, a happier, more favourable demeanour in regard
to sensuality, resembling rather the position taken up by Goethe; a
prouder feeling has also been developed in knowledge, and the "reine
Thor"[6]meets with little faith.[6]This is a reference to Wagner'sParsifal.The character
as is well known, is written to represent a son of heart's affliction,
and a child of wisdom—humble, guileless, loving, pure, and a
fool.—TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.119.We "objective people."—It is not "pity" that opens up the way forusto all that is most remote and most strange in life and culture;
but ouraccessibility and ingenuousness, which precisely does not
"pity," but rather takes pleasure in hundreds of things which formerly
caused pain (which in former days either outraged or moved us, or in
the presence of which we were either hostile or indifferent). Pain in
all its various phases is now interesting to us: on that account we are
certainlynotthe more pitiful, even though the sight of pain may
shake us to our foundations and move us to tears: and we are absolutely
not inclined to be more helpful in view thereof.In thisdeliberatedesire to look on at all pain and error, we have
grown stronger and more powerful than in the eighteenth century; it
is a proof of our increase of strength (we havedrawn closerto the
seventeenth and sixteenth centuries). But it is a profound mistake
to regard our "romanticism" as a proof of our "beautified souls." We
wantstrongersensations than allcoarserages and classes have
wanted. (This fact must not be confounded with the needs of neurotics
and decadents; in their case, of course, there is a craving for pepper
—even for cruelty.)We are all seeking conditionswhich are emancipated fromthe
bourgeois, and to a greater degree from the priestly, notion of
morality (every book which savours at all of priestdom and theology
gives us the impression of pitifulniaiserieand mental indigence).
"Good company," in fact, finds everything insipid which is not
forbidden and considered compromising in bourgeois circles; and the
case is the same with books, music, politics, and opinions on women.120.The simplification of man in the nineteenth century(The eighteenth
century was that of elegance, subtlety, and generous feeling).—Not
"return to nature"; for no natural humanity has ever existed yet.
Scholastic, unnatural, and antinatural values are the rule and the
beginning; man only reaches Nature after a long struggle—he never
turns his "back" to her.... To be natural means, to dare to be as
immoral as Nature is.We are coarser, more direct, richer in irony towards generous feelings,
even when we are beneath them.Ourhaute volée,the society consisting of our rich and leisured
men, is more natural: people hunt each other, the love of the sexes
is a kind of sport in which marriage is both a charm and an obstacle;
people entertain each other and live for the sake of pleasure; bodily
advantages stand in the first rank, and curiosity and daring are the
rule.Our attitude towardsknowledgeis more natural; we are innocent
in our absolute spiritual debauchery, we hate pathetic and hieratic
manners, we delight in that which is most strictly prohibited, we
should scarcely recognise any interest in knowledge if we were bored in
acquiring it.Our attitude tomoralityis also more natural. Principles have become
a laughing-stock; no one dares to speak of his "duty," unless in irony.
But a helpful, benevolent disposition is highly valued. (Morality is
located ininstinctand the rest isdespised. Besides this there are
few points of honour.)Our attitude topoliticsis more natural: we see problems of power,
of the quantum of power, against another quantum. We do not believe in
a right that does not proceed from a power which is able to uphold it.
We regard all rights as conquests.Our valuation ofgreat men and thingsis more natural: we regard
passion as a privilege; we can conceive of nothing great which does not
involve a great crime; all greatness is associated in our minds with a
certain standing-beyond-the-pale in morality.Our attitude toNatureis more natural: we no longer love her for her
"innocence," her "reason," her "beauty," we have made her beautifully
devilish and "foolish." But instead of despising her on that account,
since then we have felt more closely related to her and more familiar
in her presence. She doesnotaspire to virtue: we therefore respect
her.Our attitude towardsArtis more natural: we do not exact beautiful,
empty lies, etc., from her; brutal positivism reigns supreme, and it
ascertains things with perfect calm.In short: there are signs showing that the European of the nineteenth
century is less ashamed of his instincts; he has gone a long way
towards acknowledging his unconditional naturalness and immorality,without bitterness: on the contrary, he is strong enough to endure
this point of view alone.To some ears this will sound as thoughcorruptionhad made strides:
and certain it is that man has not drawn nearer to the "Nature"
which Rousseauspeaks about, but has gone one step farther in the
civilisation before which Rousseaustood in horror.We have grownstronger,we have drawn nearer to the seventeenth century, more
particularly to the taste which reigned towards its close (Dancourt, Le
Sage, Renard).121.CultureversusCivilisation.—The culminating stages of culture
and civilisation lie apart: one must not be led astray as regards the
fundamental antagonism existing between culture and civilisation.
From the moral standpoint, great periods in the history of culture
have always been periods of corruption; while on the other hand,
those periods in which man was deliberately and compulsorilytamed("civilisation") have always been periods of intolerance towards the
most intellectual and most audacious natures. Civilisation desires
something different from what culture strives after: their aims may
perhaps be opposed....122.What I warn people against: confounding the instincts of decadence
with those ofhumanity;Confounding thedissolving meansof civilisationand those which
necessarily promote decadence,withculture;Confoundingdebauchery,and the principle, "laisser aller," with theWill to Power(the latter is the exact reverse of the former).123.The unsolved problems which I set anew: theproblem of civilisation,the struggle between Rousseau and Voltaire about the year 1760. Man
becomes deeper, more mistrustful, more "immoral," stronger, more
self-confident—and therefore "more natural"; that is "progress."
In this way, by a process of division of labour, the more evil strata
and the milder and tamer strata of society get separated: so thatthe
general factsare not visible at first sight.... It is a sign ofstrength,and of the self-control and fascination of the strong, that
these stronger strata possess the arts in order to make their greater
powers for evil felt as something "higher" As soon as there is
"progress" there is a transvaluation of the strengthened factors into
the "good."124.Man must have thecourageof his natural instincts restored to him.—The poor opinionhe has of himself must be destroyed (notin the
sense of the individual, but in the sense of thenaturalman ...)—Thecontradictionsin things must be eradicated, after it has been
well understood that we were responsible for them—Social idiosyncrasiesmust be stamped out of existence (guilt,
punishment, justice, honesty, freedom, love, etc. etc.)—An advance towards "naturalness": in all political questions, even
in the relations between parties, even in merchants', workmen's, or
contractors'parties, onlyquestionsofpowercome into play:—
"what onecando" is the first question, what one ought to do is only
a secondary consideration.125.Socialism—or thetyrannyof the meanest and the most
brainless,—that is to say, the superficial, the envious, and the
mummers, brought to its zenith,—is, as a matter, of fact, the logical
conclusion of "modern ideas" and their latent anarchy: but in the
genial atmosphere of democratic well-being the capacity for forming
resolutions or even for comingto an endat all, is paralysed. Men
follow—but no longer their reason. That is why socialism is on the
whole a hopelessly bitter affair: and there is nothing more amusing
than to observe the discord between the poisonous and desperate faces
of present-day socialists—and what wretched and nonsensical feelings
does not their style reveal to us!—and the childish lamblike happiness
of their hopes and desires. Nevertheless, in many places in Europe,
there may be violent hand-to-hand struggles and irruptions on their
account: the coming century is likely to be convulsed in more than
one spot, and the Paris Commune, which finds defenders and advocates
even in Germany, will seem to have been but a slight indigestion
compared with what is to come. Be this as it may, there will always
be too many people of property for socialism ever to signify anything
more than an attack of illness: and these people of property are like
one man with one faith, "one must possess something inorderto
besome one." This, however, is the oldest and most wholesome of
all instincts; I should add: "one must desire more than one has in
order tobecomemore." For this is the teaching which life itself
preaches to all living things: the morality of Development. To have
and to wish to have more, in a word,Growth—that is life itself.
In the teaching of socialism "a will to the denial of life" is but
poorly concealed: botched men and races they must be who have devised
a teaching of this sort. In fact, I even wish a few experiments might
be made to show that in a socialistic society, life denies itself,
and itself cuts away its own roots. The earth is big enough and man
is still unexhausted enough for a practical lesson of this sort anddemonstratio ad absurdum—even if it were accomplished only by a vast
expenditure of lives—to seem worth while to me. Still, Socialism,
like a restless mole beneath the foundations of a society wallowing in
stupidity, will be able to achieve something useful and salutary: it
delays "Peace on Earth" and the whole process of character-softening of
the democratic herding animal; it forces the European to have an extra
supply of intellect,—that is to say, craft and caution, and prevents
his entirely abandoning the manly and warlike qualities,—it also saves
Europe awhile from themarasmus femininuswhich is threatening it.126.The most favourable obstacles and remedies of modernity:(1) Compulsorymilitary servicewith real wars in which all joking is
laid aside.(2)Nationalthick-headedness (which simplifies and concentrates).(3) Improvednutrition(meat).(4) Increasingcleanlinessand wholesomeness in the home.(5) The predominance ofphysiologyover theology, morality,
economics, and politics.(6) Military discipline in the exaction and the practice of one's
"duty" (it is no longer customary to praise).127.I am delighted at the military development of Europe, also at the inner
anarchical conditions: the period of quietude and "Chinadom" which
Galiani prophesied for this century is now over. Personal andmanlycapacity, bodily capacity recovers its value, valuations are becoming
more physical, nutrition consists ever more and more of flesh. Fine
men have once more become possible. Bloodless sneaks (with mandarins
at their head, as Comte imagined them) are now a matter of the past.
The savage in every one of us isacknowledged,even the wild animal.Precisely on that account,philosophers will have a better chance.
—Kant is a scarecrow!128.I have not yetseenany reasons to feel discouraged. He who acquires
and preserves astrong will,together with a broad mind, has a more
favourable chance now than ever he had. For theplasticityof man has
become exceedingly great in democratic Europe: men who learn easily,
who readily adapt themselves, are the rule: the gregarious animal of
a high order of intelligence is prepared. He who would command finds
those whomustobey: I have Napoleon and Bismarck in mind, for
instance. The struggle against strong and unintelligent wills, which
forms the surest obstacle in one's way, is really insignificant Who
would not be able to knock down these "objective" gentlemen with weak
wills, such as Ranke and Renan!129.Spiritual enlightenmentis an unfailing means of making men
uncertain, weak of will, and needful of succour and support; in
short, of developing the herding instincts in them. That is why all
great artist-rulers, hitherto (Confucius in China, the Roman Empire,
Napoleon, Popedom—at a time when they had the courage of their
worldliness and frankly pursued power) in whom the ruling instincts,
that had prevailed until their time, culminated, also made use of the
spiritual enlightenment—or at least allowed it to be supreme (after
the style of the Popes of the Renaissance). The self-deception of
the masses on this point, in every democracy for instance, is of the
greatest possible value: all that makes men smaller and more amenable
is pursued under the title "progress."130.The highest equity and mildness as a condition ofweakness(the New
Testament and the early Christian community—manifesting itself in the
form of utter foolishness in the Englishmen, Darwin and Wallace). Your
equity, ye higher men, drives you to universal suffrage, etc.; your
"humanity" urges you to be milder towards crime and stupidity. In theendyou will thus help stupidity and harmlessness to conquer.Outwardly: Ages of terrible wars, insurrections, explosions.Inwardly: ever more and more weakness among men;eventstake theform of excitants.The Parisian as the type of the European extreme.Consequences: (1) Savages (at first, of course, in conformity with
the culture that has reigned hitherto); (2)Sovereign individuals(wherepowerfulbarbarousmassesand emancipation from all that
has been, are crossed). The age of greatest stupidity, brutality, and
wretchedness in the masses, andin the highest individuals.131.An incalculable number of higher individuals now perish: but he whoescapes their fateis as strong as the devil. In this respect we are
reminded of the conditions which prevailed in the Renaissance.132.How areGood Europeanssuch as ourselves distinguished from the
patriots? In the first place,we are atheists and immoralists, but we
take care to support the religions and the morality which we associate
with the gregarious instinct: for by means of them, an order of men is,
so to speak, being prepared, which must at some time or other fall into
our hands, which must actuallycravefor our hands.Beyond Good and Evil,—certainly; but we insist upon the unconditional
and strict preservation of herd-morality.We reserve ourselves the right to several kinds of philosophy which it
is necessary to learn: under certain circumstances, the pessimistic
kind as a hammer; a European Buddhism might perhaps be indispensable.We should probably support the development and the maturation of
democratic tendencies; for it conduces to weakness of will: in
"Socialism" we recognise a thorn which prevents smug ease.Attitude towards the people.. Our prejudices; we pay attention to the
results of cross-breeding.Detached, well-to-do, strong: irony concerning the "press" and its
culture. Our care: that scientific men should not become journalists.
We mistrust any form of culture that tolerates news-paper reading or
writing.We make our accidental positions (as Goethe and Stendhal did), our
experiences, a foreground, and we lay stress upon them, so that we
may deceive concerning our backgrounds. We ourselveswaitand
avoid putting our heart into them. They serve us as refuges, such as
a wanderer might require and use—but we avoid feeling at home in
them.We are ahead of our fellows in that we have had adisciplina
voluntatis.All strength is directed to thedevelopment of the will,an art which allows us to wear masks, an art of understandingbeyondthe passions (also "super-European" thought at times).This is our preparation before becoming the law-givers of the future
and the lords of the earth; if not we, at least our children. Caution
where marriage is concerned.133.The twentieth century.—The Abbé Galiani says somewhere: "La
prévoyance est la cause des guerres actuelles de l'Europe. Si l'on
voulait se donner la peine de ne rien prévoir, tout le monde serait
tranquille, et je ne crois pas qu'on serait plus malheureux parce qu'on
ne ferait pas la guerre." As I in no way share the unwarlike views of
my deceased friend Galiani, I have no fear whatever of saying something
beforehand with the view of conjuring in some way the cause of wars.A condition of excessiveconsciousness,after the worst of
earthquakes: with new questions.134.It is the time of thegreat noon, of the most appalling
enlightenment: my particular kind ofPessimism: the great
starting-point.(1) Fundamental contradiction between civilisation and the elevation of
man.(2) Moral valuations regarded as a history of lies and the art of
calumny in the service of the Will to Power (of the will of theherd,which rises against stronger men).(3) The conditions which determine every elevation in culture (the
facilitation of aselectionbeing made at the cost of a crowd) are
theconditionsof all growth.(4).The multiformityof the world as a question ofstrength,which sees all things in theperspective of their growth.The moral
Christian values to be regarded as the insurrection and mendacity of
slaves (in comparison with the aristocratic values of theancient
world).SECOND BOOK.CRITICISM OF THE HIGHEST VALUES THAT HAVE PREVAILED HITHERTO.I.CRITICISM OF RELIGION.All the beauty and sublimity with which we have invested real and
imagined things, I will show to be the property and product of man, and
this should be his most beautiful apology. Man as a poet, as a thinker,
as a god, as love, as power. Oh, the regal liberality with which he
has lavished gifts upon things in orderto impoverishhimself and
make himself feel wretched! Hitherto, this has been his greatest
disinterestedness, that he admired and worshipped, and knew how to
conceal from himself thatheit was who had created what he admired.1. Concerning the Origin of Religions.135.The origin of religion.—Just as the illiterate man of to-day
believes that his wrath is the cause of his being angry, that his
mind is the cause of his thinking, that his soul is the cause of
his feeling, in short, just as a mass of psychological entities
are still unthinkingly postulated as causes;so, in a still more
primitive age, the same phenomena were interpreted by man by means of
personal entities. Those conditions of his soul which seemed strange,
overwhelming, and rapturous, he regarded as obsessions and bewitching
influences emanating from the power of some personality. (Thus the
Christian, the most puerile and backward man of this age, traces hope,
peace, and the feeling of deliverance to a psychological inspiration
on the part of God: being by nature a sufferer and a creature in need
of repose, states of happiness, peace, and resignation, perforce seem
strange to him, and seem to need some explanation.) Among intelligent,
strong, and vigorous races, the epileptic is mostly the cause of a
belief in the existence of someforeign power; but all such examples
of apparent subjection—as, for instance, the bearing of the exalted
man, of the poet, of the great criminal, or the passions, love and
revenge—lead to the invention of supernatural powers. A condition is
made concrete by being identified with a personality, and when this
condition overtakes anybody, it is ascribed to that personality. In
other words: in the psychological concept of God, a certain state of
the soul is personified as a cause in order to appear as an effect.The psychological logic is as follows: when thefeeling of powersuddenly seizes and overwhelms a man,—and this takes place in the
case of all the great passions,—a doubt arises in him concerning his
own person: he dare not think himself the cause of this astonishing
sensation—and thushe posits astrongerperson, a Godhead as its
cause. In short, the origin of religion lies in the extreme feelings
of power, which, beingstrange,take men by surprise: and just
as the sick man, who feels one of his limbs unaccountably heavy,
concludes that another man must be sitting on it, so the ingenuoushomo religiosus,divides himself up intoseveral people.Religion
is an example of the "altération de la personalité." A sort offearandsensation of terrorin one's own presence.... But also a feeling
of inordinateraptureandexaltation.Among sick people, thesensation of healthsuffices to awaken a belief in the proximity of
God.136.Rudimentary psychology of the religious man:—All changes are
effects; all effects are effects of will (the notion of "Nature"
and of "natural law," is lacking); all effects presuppose an agent.
Rudimentary psychology: one is only a cause oneself, when one knows
that one has willed something.Result: States of power impute to man the feeling that he isnotthe
cause of them, that he is notresponsiblefor them: they come without
being willed to do so—consequently we cannot be their originators:
will that is not free (that is to say, the knowledge of a change in our
condition which we have not helped to bring about) requires astrongwill.Consequence of this rudimentary psychology: Man has never dared to
credithimselfwith hisstrong and startling moods, he has always
conceived them as "passive," as "imposed upon him from outside":
Religion is the offshoot of adoubtconcerning the entity of the
person, analtérationof the personality: in so far as everything
great and strong in man was consideredsuperhumanandforeign,man
belittled himself,—he laid the two sides, the very pitiable and weak
side, and the very strong and startling side apart, in two spheres, and
called the one "Man" and the other "God."And he has continued to act on these lines; during the period of themoral idiosyncrasyhe did not interpret his lofty and sublime moral
states as "proceeding from his own will" or as the "work" of the
person. Even the Christian himself divides his personality into two
parts, the one a mean and weak fiction which he calls man, and the
other which he calls God (Deliverer and Saviour).Religion has lowered the concept "man"; its ultimate conclusion is
that all goodness, greatness, and truth are superhuman, and are only
obtainable by the grace of God.137.One way of raising man out of his self-abasement, which brought about
the decline of the point of view that classed all lofty and strong
states of the soul, as strange, was the theory of relationship. These
lofty and strong states of the soul could at least be interpreted as
the influence of ourforebears; we belonged to each other, we wereirrevocably joined; we grew in our own esteem, by acting according to
the example of a model known to us all.There is an attempt on the part of noble families to associate religion
with their own feelings of self-respect. Poets and seers do the same
thing; they feel proud that they have been worthy,—that they have beenselectedfor such association,—they esteem it an honour, not to be
considered at all as individuals, but as mere mouthpieces (Homer).Man gradually takes possession of the highest and proudest states of
his soul, as also of his acts and his works. Formerly it was believed
that one paid oneself the greatest honour by denying one's own
responsibility for the highest deeds one accomplished, and by ascribing
them to—God. The will which was not free, appeared to be that which
imparted a higher value to a deed: in those days a god was postulated
as the author of the deed.138.Priests are the actors of something which is supernatural, either in
the way of ideals, gods, or saviours, and they have to make people
believe in them; in this they find their calling, this is the purpose
of their instincts; in order to make it as credible as possible, they
have to exert themselves to the utmost extent in the art of posing;
their actor's sagacity must, above all, aim at giving thema clean
conscience,by means of which, alone, it is possible to persuade
effectively.139.The priest wishes to make it an understood thing, that he is thehighest typeof man, that he rules,—even over those who wield the
power,—that he is indispensable and unassailable,—that he is thestrongest powerin the community, not by any means to be replaced or
undervalued.Means thereto: he alone is cultured; he alone is theman of virtue;
he alone hassovereign power over himself: he alone is, in a certain
sense, God, and ultimately goes back to the Godhead; he alone is the
middleman between God andothers; the Godhead administers punishment
to every one who puts the priest at a disadvantage, or who thinks in
opposition to him.Means thereto: Truthexists. There is only one way of attaining to
it, and that is to become a priest. Everything good, which relates
either to order, nature, or tradition, is to be traced to the wisdom
of the priests. The Holy Book is their work. The whole of nature is
only a fulfilment of the maxims which it contains. No othersource of
goodnessexists than the priests. Every other kind of perfection, even
thewarrior's,is different in rank from that of the priests.Consequence: If the priest is to be thehighesttype, then thedegreeswhich lead to hisvirtuesmust be the degrees of value
among men.Study, emancipation from material things, inactivity,
impassibility, absence of passion, solemnity;—the opposite of all
this is found in thelowesttype of man.The priest has taught a kind of morality which conduced to his being
considered thehighest typeof man. He conceives atypewhich
is thereverseof his own: the Chandala. By makingtheseas
contemptible as possible, some strength is lent to theorder of
castes.The priest's excessive fear ofsensualityalso implies that
the latter is the most serious threat to theorder of castes(that is
to say,orderin general).... Every "free tendency"in puncto puncti
overthrowsthe laws of marriage.140.Thephilosopherconsidered as the development of thepriestlytype:—He has the heritage of the priest in his blood; even as a rival
he is compelled to fight with the same weapons as the priest of his
time;—he aspires to thehighest authority.What is it that bestowsauthorityupon men who have no physical power
to wield (no army, no arms at all ...)? How do such men gain authorityoverthose who are in possession of material power, and who represent
authority? (Philosophers enter the lists against princes, victorious
conquerors, and wise statesmen.)They can do it only by establishing the belief that they are in
possession of a power which is higher and stronger—God.Nothing is
strong enough: every one is inneedof the mediation and the services
of priests. They establish themselves as indispensableintercessors.The conditions of their existence are: (1) That people believe in the
absolute superiority of their god, in fact believeintheir god;
(2) that there is no other access, no direct access to god, save
through them. Thesecondcondition alone gives rise to the concept
"heterodoxy"; thefirstto the concept "disbelievers" (that is to
say, he who believes in another god).141.A Criticism of the Holy Lie.—That a lie is allowed in pursuit
of holy ends 'is a principle which belongs to the theory of all
priestcraft, and the object of this inquiry is to discover to what
extent it belongs to its practice.But philosophers, too, whenever they intend taking over the leadership
of mankind, with the ulterior motives of priests in their minds, have
never failed to arrogate to themselves the right to lie: Plato above
all. But the most elaborate of lies is the double lie, developed
by the typically Arian philosophers of the Vedanta: two systems,
contradicting each other in all their main points, but interchangeable,
complementary, and mutually expletory, when educational ends were in
question. The lie of the one has to create a condition in which the
truth of the other can alone becomeintelligible....Howfardoes the holy lie of priests and philosophers go?—The
question here is, what hypotheses do they advance in regard to
education, and what are the dogmas they are compelled toinventin
order to do justice to these hypotheses?First: they must have power, authority, and absolute credibility on
their side.Secondly: they must have the direction of the whole of Nature, so that
everything affecting the individual seems to be determined by their law.Thirdly: their domain of power must be very extensive, in order that
its control may escape the notice of those they subject: they must know
the penal code of the life beyond—of the life "after death,"—and, of
course, the means whereby the road to blessedness may be discovered.
They have to put the notion of a natural course of things out of sight,
but as they are intelligent and thoughtful people, they are able topromisea host of effects, which they naturally say are conditioned
by prayer or by the strict observance of their law. They can, moreover,prescribea large number of things which are exceedingly reasonable
—only they must not point to experience or empiricism as the source
of this wisdom, but to revelation or to the fruits of the "most severe
exercises of penance."
