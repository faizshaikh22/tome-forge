JEST, RUSE AND REVENGE.A PRELUDE IN RHYME.1.Invitation.Venture, comrades, I implore you,On the fare I set before you,You will like it more to-morrow,Better still the following day:If yet more you're then requiring,Old success I'll find inspiring,And fresh courage thence will borrowNovel dainties to display.2.My Good Luck.Weary of Seeking had I grown,So taught myself the way to Find:Back by the storm I once was blown,But follow now, where drives the wind.3.Undismayed.Where you're standing, dig, dig out:Down below's the Well:Let them that walk in darkness shout:"Down below—there's Hell!"4.Dialogue.A.Was I ill? and is it ended?Pray, by what physician tended?I recall no pain endured!B.Now I know your trouble's ended:He that can forget, is cured.5.To the Virtuous.Let our virtues be easy and nimble-footed in motion,Like unto Homer's verse ought they to comeand to go.6.Worldly Wisdom.Stay not on level plain,Climb not the mount too high,But half-way up remain—The world you'll best descry!7.Vademecum—Vadetecum.Attracted by my style and talkYou'd follow, in my footsteps walk?Follow yourself unswervingly,So—careful!—shall you follow me.8.The Third Sloughing.My skin bursts, breaks for fresh rebirth,And new desires come thronging:Much I've devoured, yet for more earthThe serpent in me's longing.'Twixt stone and grass I crawl once more,Hungry, by crooked ways,To eat the food I ate before,Earth-fare all serpents praise!9.My Roses.My luck's good—I'd make yours fairer,(Good luck ever needs a sharer),Will you stop and pluck my roses?Oft mid rocks and thorns you'll linger,Hide and stoop, suck bleeding finger—Will you stop and pluck my roses?For my good luck's a trifle vicious,Fond of teasing, tricks malicious—Will you stop and pluck my roses?10.The Scorner.Many drops I waste and spill,So my scornful mood you curse:Who to brim his cup doth fill,Many dropsmustwaste and spill—Yet he thinks the wine no worse.11.The Proverb Speaks.Harsh and gentle, fine and mean,Quite rare and common, dirty and clean,The fools' and the sages' go-between:All this I will be, this have been,Dove and serpent and swine, I ween!12.To a Lover of Light.That eye and sense be not fordoneE'en in the shade pursue the sun!13.For Dancers.Smoothest ice,A paradiseTo him who is a dancer nice.14.The Brave Man.A feud that knows not flaw nor break,Rather then patched-up friendship, take.15.Rust.Rust's needed: keenness will not satisfy!"He is too young!" the rabble loves to cry.16.Excelsior."How shall I reach the top?" No timeFor thus reflecting! Start to climb!17.The Man of Power Speaks.Ask never! Cease that whining, pray!Take without asking, take alway!18.Narrow Souls.Narrow souls hate I like the devil,Souls wherein grows nor good nor evil.19.Accidentally a Seducer.[3]He shot an empty wordInto the empty blue;But on the way it metA woman whom it slew.20.For Consideration.A twofold pain is easier far to bearThan one: so now to suffer wilt thou dare?21.Against Pride.Brother, to puff thyself up ne'er be quick:For burst thou shalt be by a tiny prick!22.Man and Woman."The woman seize, who to thy heart appeals!"Man's motto: woman seizes not, but steals.23.Interpretation.If I explain my wisdom, surely'Tis but entangled more securely,I can't expound myself aright:But he that's boldly up and doing,His own unaided course pursuing,Upon my image casts more light!24.A Cure for Pessimism.Those old capricious fancies, friend!You say your palate naught can please,I hear you bluster, spit and wheeze,My love, my patience soon will end!Pluck up your courage, follow me—Here's a fat toad! Now then, don't blink,Swallow it whole, nor pause to think!From your dyspepsia you'll be free!25.A Request.Many men's minds I know full well,Yet what mine own is, cannot tell.I cannot see—my eye's too near—And falsely to myself appear.'Twould be to me a benefitFar from myself if I could sit,Less distant than my enemy,And yet my nearest friend's too nigh—'Twixt him and me, just in the middle!What do I ask for? Guess my riddle!26.My Cruelty.I must ascend an hundred stairs,I must ascend: the herd declaresI'm cruel: "Are we made of stone?"I must ascend an hundred stairs:All men the part of stair disown.27.The Wanderer."No longer path! Abyss and silence chilling!"Thy fault! To leave the path thou wast too willing!Now comes the test! Keep cool—eyes bright and clear!Thou'rt lost for sure, if thou permittest—fear.28.Encouragement for Beginners.See the infant, helpless creeping—Swine around it grunt swine-talk—Weeping always, naught but weeping,Will it ever learn to walk?Never fear! Just wait, I swear itSoon to dance will be inclined,And this babe, when two legs bear it,Standing on its head you'll find.29.Planet Egoism.Did I not turn, a rolling cask,Ever about myself, I ask,How could I without burning runClose on the track of the hot sun?30.The Neighbour.Too nigh, my friend my joy doth mar,I'd have him high above and far,Or how can he become my star?31.The Disguised Saint.Lest we for thy bliss should slay thee,In devil's wiles thou dost array thee,Devil's wit and devil's dress.But in vain! Thy looks betray theeAnd proclaim thy holiness.32.The Slave.A.He stands and listens: whence his pain?What smote his ears? Some far refrain?Why is his heart with anguish torn?B.Like all that fetters once have worn,He always hears the clinking—chain!33.The Lone One.I hate to follow and I hate to lead.Obedience? no! and ruling? no, indeed!Wouldst fearful be in others' sight?Then e'enthyselfthou must affright:The people but the Terror's guidance heed.I hate to guide myself, I hate the fray.Like the wild beasts I'll wander far afield.In Error's pleasing toils I'll roamAwhile, then lure myself back home,Back home, and—to my self-seduction yield.34.Seneca et hoc Genus omne.They write and write (quite maddening me)Their "sapient" twaddle airy,As if 'twereprimum scribere,Deinde philosophari.35.Ice.Yes!

'Twere better soAnd in all keyholes might the pick-lock go!"Who thus reflects ye may as—picklock know.52.Foot Writing.I write not with the hand alone,My foot would write, my foot that capers,Firm, free and bold, it's marching onNow through the fields, now through the papers.53."Human, All-too-Human."...Shy, gloomy, when your looks are backward thrust,Trusting the future where yourself you trust,Are you an eagle, mid the nobler fowl,Or are you like Minerva's darling owl?54.To my Reader.Good teeth and a digestion goodI wish you—these you need, be sure!And, certes, if my book you've stood,Me with good humour you'll endure.55.The Realistic Painter."To nature true, complete!" so he begins.Who complete Nature to his canvaswins?Her tiniest fragment's endless, no constraintCan know: he paints just what hisfancypins:What does his fancy pin?

Who reads the stuff I write?60.Loftier Spirits.This man's climbing up—let us praise him—But that other we loveFrom aloft doth eternally move,So above even praise let us raise him,Hecomesfrom above!61.The Sceptic Speaks.Your life is half-way o'er;The clock-hand moves; your soul is thrilled with fear,It roamed to distant shoreAnd sought and found not, yet you—linger here!Your life is half-way o'er;That hour by hour was pain and error sheer:Why stay?What seek you more?"That's what I'm seeking—reasons why I'm here!"62.Ecce Homo.Yes, I know where I'm related,Like the flame, unquenched, unsated,I consume myself and glow:All's turned to light I lay my hand on,All to coal that I abandon,Yes, I am a flame, I know!63.Star Morality.[6]Foredoomed to spaces vast and far,What matters darkness to the star?Roll calmly on, let time go by,Let sorrows pass thee—nations die!Compassion would but dim the lightThat distant worlds will gladly sight.To thee one law—be pure and bright!
