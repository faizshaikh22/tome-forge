PREFACE TO THE SECONDEDITION.1.Perhaps more than one preface would be necessary
for this book; and after all it might still be doubtful
whether any one could be brought nearer to theexperiencesin it by means of prefaces, without
having himself experienced something similar. It
seems to be written in the language of the thawing-wind:
there is wantonness, restlessness, contradiction
and April-weather in it; so that one is
as constantly reminded of the proximity of winter as
of thevictoryover it: the victory which is coming,
which must come, which has perhaps already
come.... Gratitude continually flows forth, as
if the most unexpected thing had happened, the
gratitude of a convalescent—forconvalescencewas
this most unexpected thing. "Joyful Wisdom":
that implies the Saturnalia of a spirit which has
patiently withstood a long, frightful pressure—patiently,
strenuously, impassionately, without
submitting, but without hope—and which is now
suddenly o'erpowered with hope, the hope of
health, theintoxicationof convalescence. What
wonder that much that is unreasonable and
foolish thereby comes to light: much wanton
tenderness expended even on problems whichhave a prickly hide, and are not therefore fit to be
fondled and allured. The whole book is really
nothing but a revel after long privation and impotence:
the frolicking of returning energy, of
newly awakened belief in a to-morrow and after-to-morrow;
of sudden sentience and prescience of
a future, of near adventures, of seas open once
more, and aims once more permitted and believed
in. And what was now all behind me! This
track of desert, exhaustion, unbelief, and frigidity
in the midst of youth, this advent of grey
hairs at the wrong time, this tyranny of pain,
surpassed, however, by the tyranny of pride which
repudiated theconsequencesof pain—and consequences
are comforts,—this radical isolation, as
defence against the contempt of mankind become
morbidly clairvoyant, this restriction upon principle
to all that is bitter, sharp, and painful in knowledge,
as prescribed by thedisgustwhich had gradually
resulted from imprudent spiritual diet and pampering—it
is called Romanticism,—oh, who could
realise all those feelings of mine! He, however,
who could do so would certainly forgive me
everything, and more than a little folly, boisterousness
and "Joyful Wisdom"—for example, the
handful of songs which are given along with
the book on this occasion,—songs in which a poet
makes merry over all poets in a way not easily
pardoned.—Alas, it is not only on the poets
and their fine "lyrical sentiments" that this
reconvalescent must vent his malignity: who knows
what kind of victim he seeks, what kind of monster
of material for parody will allure him ere long?Incipit tragœdia, it is said at the conclusion of this
seriously frivolous book; let people be on their
guard! Something or other extraordinarily bad
and wicked announces itself:incipit parodia, there
is no doubt...2.——But let us leave Herr Nietzsche; what does it
matter to people that Herr Nietzsche has got well
again?... A psychologist knows few questions
so attractive as those concerning the relations of
health to philosophy, and in the case when he
himself falls sick, he carries with him all his
scientific curiosity into his sickness. For, granting
that one is a person, one has necessarily also the
philosophy of one's personality, there is, however, an
important distinction here. With the one it is his
defects which philosophise, with the other it is his
riches and powers. The formerrequireshis philosophy,
whether it be as support, sedative, or
medicine, as salvation, elevation, or self-alienation;
with the latter it is merely a fine luxury, at best
the voluptuousness of a triumphant gratitude, which
must inscribe itself ultimately in cosmic capitals
on the heaven of ideas. In the other more usual
case, however, when states of distress occupy themselves
with philosophy (as is the case with all sickly
thinkers—and perhaps the sickly thinkers preponderate
in the history of philosophy), what will
happen to the thought itself which is brought
under thepressureof sickness? This is the important
question for psychologists: and here
experiment is possible. We philosophers do justlike a traveller who resolves to awake at a given
hour, and then quietly yields himself to sleep: we
surrender ourselves temporarily, body and soul, to
the sickness, supposing we become ill—we shut, as
it were, our eyes on ourselves. And as the traveller
knows that somethingdoes notsleep, that something
counts the hours and will awake him, we also know
that the critical moment will find us awake—that
then something will spring forward and surprise
the spiritin the very act, I mean in weakness, or
reversion, or submission, or obduracy, or obscurity,
or whatever the morbid conditions are called, which
in times of good health have theprideof the spirit
opposed to them (for it is as in the old rhyme:
"The spirit proud, peacock and horse are the three
proudest things of earthly source"). After such
self-questioning and self-testing, one learns to look
with a sharper eye at all that has hitherto been
philosophised; one divines better than before the
arbitrary by-ways, side-streets, resting-places, andsunnyplaces of thought, to which suffering thinkers,
precisely as sufferers, are led and misled: one
knows now in what direction the sicklybodyand
its requirements unconsciously press, push, and
allure the spirit—towards the sun, stillness, gentleness,
patience, medicine, refreshment in any sense
whatever. Every philosophy which puts peace
higher than war, every ethic with a negative grasp
of the idea of happiness, every metaphysic and
physic that knows afinale, an ultimate condition
of any kind whatever, every predominating, æsthetic
or religious longing for an aside, a beyond, an outside,
an above—all these permit one to ask whethersickness has not been the motive which inspired the
philosopher. The unconscious disguising of physiological
requirements under the cloak of the objective,
the ideal, the purely spiritual, is carried on to an
alarming extent,—and I have often enough asked
myself, whether, on the whole, philosophy hitherto
has not generally been merely an interpretation
of the body, and amisunderstanding of the
body. Behind the loftiest estimates of value by
which the history of thought has hitherto been
governed, misunderstandings of the bodily constitution,
either of individuals, classes, or entire races
are concealed. One may always primarily consider
these audacious freaks of metaphysic, and especially
its answers to the question of theworthof existence,
as symptoms of certain bodily constitutions; and if,
on the whole, when scientifically determined, not a
particle of significance attaches to such affirmations
and denials of the world, they nevertheless
furnish the historian and psychologist with hints
so much the more valuable (as we have said) as
symptoms of the bodily constitution, its good or bad
condition, its fullness, powerfulness, and sovereignty
in history; or else of its obstructions, exhaustions,
and impoverishments, its premonition of the end,
its will to the end. I still expect that a philosophicalphysician, in the exceptional sense of the
word—one who applies himself to the problem of
the collective health of peoples, periods, races, and
mankind generally—will some day have the courage
to follow out my suspicion to its ultimate conclusions,
and to venture on the judgment that in
all philosophising it has not hitherto been a questionof "truth" at all, but of something else,—namely,
of health, futurity, growth, power, life....3.It will be surmised that I should not like to take
leave ungratefully of that period of severe sickness,
the advantage of which is not even yet exhausted
in me: for I am sufficiently conscious of what I
have in advance of the spiritually robust generally,
in my changeful state of health. A philosopher
who has made the tour of many states of
health, and always makes it anew, has also gone
through just as many philosophies: he reallycannotdo otherwise than transform his condition
on every occasion into the most ingenious posture
and position,—this art of transfigurationisjust
philosophy. We philosophers are not at liberty
to separate soul and body, as the people separate
them; and we are still less at liberty to separate
soul and spirit. We are not thinking frogs, we
are not objectifying and registering apparatuses
with cold entrails,—our thoughts must be continually
born to us out of our pain, and we must,
motherlike, share with them all that we have in
us of blood, heart, ardour, joy, passion, pang,
conscience, fate and fatality. Life—that means
for us to transform constantly into light and flame
all that we are, and also all that we meet with;
wecannotpossibly do otherwise. And as regards
sickness, should we not be almost tempted to ask
whether we could in general dispense with it? It
is great pain only which is the ultimate emancipator
of the spirit; for it is the teacher of thestrong suspicionwhich makes an X out of every U[1], a true,
correct X,i.e., the ante-penultimate letter.... It is
great pain only, the long slow pain which takes
time, by which we are burned as it were with
green wood, that compels us philosophers to descend
into our ultimate depths, and divest ourselves
of all trust, all good-nature, veiling, gentleness, and
averageness, wherein we have perhaps formerly
installed our humanity. I doubt whether such
pain "improves" us; but I know that itdeepensus. Be it that we learn to confront it with our
pride, our scorn, our strength of will, doing like the
Indian who, however sorely tortured, revenges himself
on his tormentor with his bitter tongue; be it
that we withdraw from the pain into the oriental
nothingness—it is called Nirvana,—into mute,
benumbed, deaf self-surrender, self-forgetfulness,
and self-effacement: one emerges from such long,
dangerous exercises in self-mastery as another being,
with several additional notes of interrogation, and
above all, with thewillto question more than ever,
more profoundly, more strictly, more sternly, more
wickedly, more quietly than has ever been questioned
hitherto. Confidence in life is gone: life
itself has become aproblem.—Let it not be imagined
that one has necessarily become a hypochondriac
thereby! Even love of life is still possible—only
one loves differently. It is the love of a woman
of whom one is doubtful.... The charm, however,
of all that is problematic, the delight in the
X, is too great in those more spiritual and more
spiritualised men, not to spread itself again and
again like a clear glow over all the trouble of the
problematic, over all the danger of uncertainty,
and even over the jealousy of the lover. We know
a new happiness....4.Finally, (that the most essential may not remain
unsaid), one comes back out of such abysses, out
of such severe sickness, and out of the sickness of
strong suspicion—new-born, with the skin cast;
more sensitive, more wicked, with a finer taste for
joy, with a more delicate tongue for all good
things, with a merrier disposition, with a second
and more dangerous innocence in joy; more
childish at the same time, and a hundred times
more refined than ever before. Oh, how repugnant
to us now is pleasure, coarse, dull, drab
pleasure, as the pleasure-seekers, our "cultured"
classes, our rich and ruling classes, usually understand
it! How malignantly we now listen to the
great holiday-hubbub with which "cultured people"
and city-men at present allow themselves to be
forced to "spiritual enjoyment" by art, books, and
music, with the help of spirituous liquors! How
the theatrical cry of passion now pains our ear, how
strange to our taste has all the romantic riot and
sensuous bustle which the cultured populace love
become (together with their aspirations after the
exalted, the elevated, and the intricate)! No, if
we convalescents need an art at all, it isanotherart—a mocking, light, volatile, divinely serene,divinely ingenious art, which blazes up like a clear
flame, into a cloudless heaven! Above all, an art
for artists, only for artists! We at last know
better what is first of all necessaryfor it—namely,
cheerfulness,everykind of cheerfulness, my friends!
also as artists:—I should like to prove it. We now
know something too well, we men of knowledge:
oh, how well we are now learning to forget andnotknow, as artists! And as to our future, we are not
likely to be found again in the tracks of those
Egyptian youths who at night make the temples
unsafe, embrace statues, and would fain unveil,
uncover, and put in clear light, everything which
for good reasons is kept concealed.[2]No, we have
got disgusted with this bad taste, this will to truth,
to "truth at all costs," this youthful madness in
the love of truth: we are now too experienced, too
serious, too joyful, too singed, too profound for
that.... We no longer believe that truth remains
truth when the veil is withdrawn from it: we have
lived long enough to believe this. At present we
regard it as a matter of propriety not to be anxious
either to see everything naked, or to be present at
everything, or to understand and "know" everything.
"Is it true that the good God is everywhere
present?" asked a little girl of her mother: "I
think that is indecent":—a hint to philosophers!
One should have more reverence for theshamefacednesswith which nature has concealed herself
behind enigmas and motley uncertainties. Perhaps
truth is a woman who has reasons for not
showing her reasons? Perhaps her name is Baubo,
to speak in Greek?... Oh, those Greeks! They
knew howto live: for that purpose it is necessary to
keep bravely to the surface, the fold and the skin;
to worship appearance, to believe in forms, tones,
and words, in the whole Olympus of appearance!
Those Greeks were superficial—from profundity!
And are we not coming back precisely to this
point, we dare-devils of the spirit, who have scaled
the highest and most dangerous peak of contemporary
thought, and have looked around us from
it, havelooked downfrom it? Are we not precisely
in this respect—Greeks? Worshippers of forms,
of tones, and of words? And precisely on that
account—artists?Ruta, nearGenoaAutumn, 1886.
