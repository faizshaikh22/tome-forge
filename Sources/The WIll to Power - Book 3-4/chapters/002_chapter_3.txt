[3]The reference to Stendhal here, seems to point to a
passage in hisLife of Napoleon(Preface, p. xv) of which Nietzsche
had made a note in another place, and which reads: "Une croyance
presque instinctive chez moi c'est que tout homme puissant ment quand
il parle et à plus forte raison quand il écrit."(h)Against Causality.545.I believe in absolute space as the basis of force, and I believe the
latter to be limited and formed. Time, eternal. But space and time
as things in themselves do not exist. "Changes" are only appearances
(or mere processes of our senses to us); if we set recurrence,
however regular, between them, nothing is proved beyond the fact that
it has always happened so. The feeling thatpost hocispropter
hoc,is easily explained as the result of a misunderstanding, it is
comprehensible. But appearances cannot be "causes"!546.The interpretation of a phenomenon,eitheras an actionoras the
endurance of an action (that is to say, every action involves the
suffering of it), amounts to this: every change, every differentiation,
presupposes the existence of an agent and somebody acted upon,whois
"altered."547.Psychological history of the conceptsubject.The body, the thing,
the "whole," which is visualised by the eye, awakens the thought of
distinguishing between an action and an agent; the idea that the agent
is the cause of the action, after having been repeatedly refined, at
length left the "subject" over.548.Our absurd habit of regarding a mere mnemonic sign or abbreviated
formula as an independent being, and ultimately as acause; as, for
instance, when we say of lightning that it flashes, even the little
word "I." A sort of double-sight in seeing which makes sight acause
of seeing in itself: this was the feat in the invention of the
"subject" of the "ego."549."Subject," "object," "attribute"—these distinctions have beenmade,and are now used like schemes to cover all apparent facts. The false
fundamental observation is this, that I believe it is I who does
something, who suffers something, who "has" something, who "has" a
quality.550.In every judgment lies the whole faith in subject, attribute, or cause
and effect (in the form of an assumption that every effect is the
result of activity, and that all activity presupposes an agent), and
even this last belief is only an isolated case of the first, so that
faith remains as the most fundamental belief! there are such things as
subjects, everything that happens is related attributively to a subject
of some sort.I notice something, and try to discover the reason of it: originally
this was, I look for anintentionbehind it, and, above all, I
look for one who has an intention, for a subject, an agent:every
phenomenon is an action, formerly intentions were seen behindallphenomena, this is our oldest habit. Has the animal also this habit?
As a living organism, is it not also compelled to interpret things
through itself. The question why? is always a question concerning thecausa finalis,and the general "purpose" of things. We have no sign
of the "sense of the efficient cause"; in this respect Hume is quite
right, habit (but not only that of the individual) allows us to expect
that a certain process, frequently observed, will follow upon another,
but nothing more! That which gives us such an extraordinarily firm
faith in causality, is not the rough habit of observing the sequence of
processes, but ourinabilitytointerpreta phenomenon otherwise
than as the result ofdesign.It is thebelief inliving and
thinking things, as the only agents ofcausation; it is the belief in
will, in design—the belief that all phenomena are actions, and that
all actions presuppose an agent; it is the belief in the "subject." Is
not this belief in the concepts subject and object an arrant absurdity?Question: Is the design the cause of a phenomenon? Or is that also
illusion? Is it not the phenomenon itself?551.A criticism of the concept "cause."—We have absolutely no experience
concerningcause, viewed psychologically we derive the whole concept
from the subjective conviction, thatweourselves are causes—that is
to say, that the arm moves....Butthat is an error.We distinguish
ourselves, the agents, from the action, and everywhere we make use of
this scheme—we try to discover an agent behind every phenomenon. What
have we done? We havemisunderstooda feeling of power, tension,
resistance, a muscular feeling, which is already the beginning of the
action, and posited it as a cause; or we have understood the will to
do this or that, as a cause, because the action follows it. There is
no such thing as "Cause," in those few cases in which it seemed to
be given, and in which we projected it out of ourselves inorder to
understand a phenomenon,it has been shown to be an illusion. Our
understanding of a phenomenon consisted in our inventing a subject
who was responsible for something happening, and for the manner in
which it happened. In our concept "cause" we have embraced our feeling
of will, our feeling of "freedom," our feeling of responsibility and
our design to do an action:causa efficiensandcausa finalisare
fundamentally one.We believed that an effect was explained when we could point to a state
in which it was inherent. As a matter of fact, we invent all causes
according to the scheme of the effect: the latter is known to us.... On
the other hand, we are not in a position to say of any particular thing
how it will "act." The thing, the subject the will, the design—all
inherent in the conception "cause." We try to discover things in order
to explain why something has changed. Even the "atom" is one of these
fanciful inventions like the "thing" and the "primitive subject."...At last we understand that things—consequently also atoms—effect
nothing:because they are non-existent;and that the concept
causality is quite! useless. Out of a necessary sequence of states,
the latter's causal relationship doesnotfollow (that would be
equivalent to extending theiractive principlefrom 1 to 2, to 3, to
4, to 5).There is no such thing as a cause or an effect.From the
standpoint of language we do not know how to rid ourselves of them.
But that does not matter. If I imaginemuscleseparated from its
"effects," I have denied it....In short:a phenomenon is neither effected nor capable of effecting.
Causais afaculty to effect something,superadded fancifully to
what happens....The interpretation of causality is an illusion....A "thing" is the
sum of its effects, synthetically united by means of a concept, an
image. As a matter of fact, science has robbed the concept causality
of all meaning, and has reserved it merely as an allegorical formula,
which has made it a matter of indifference whether cause or effect be
put on this side or on that. It is asserted that in two complex states
(centres of force) the quantities of energy remain constant.The calculability of a phenomenondoes not lie in the fact that
a rule is observed, or that a necessity is obeyed, or that we have
projected a law of causality into every phenomenon: it lies in therecurrence of "identical cases."There is no such thing as asense of causality,as Kant would have
us believe. We are aghast,we feel insecure, we will have something
familiar, which can be relied upon.... As soon as we are shown the
existence of something old in a new thing, we are pacified. The
so-called instinct of causality is nothing more than thefear of
the unfamiliar, and the attempt at finding something in it which is
alreadyknown.—It is not a search for causes, but for the familiar.552.To combat determinism and teleology.—From the fact that something
happens regularly, and that its occurrence may be reckoned upon, it
does not follow that it happensnecessarily.If a quantity of force
determines and conducts itself in a certain way in every particular
case, it does not prove that it has "no free will." "Mechanical
necessity" is not an established fact: it waswewho first read
into the nature of all phenomena. We interpreted the possibility offormularisingphenomena as a result of the dominion of necessary law
over all existence. But it does not follow, because I do a determined
thing, that I am bound to do it.Compulsioncannot be demonstrated
in things: all that the rule proves is this, that one and the same
phenomenon is not another phenomenon. Owing to the very fact that we
fancied the existence of subjects "agents" in things, the notion
arose that all phenomena are theconsequenceof acompulsory forceexercised over the subject—exercised by whom? once more by an "agent."
The concept "Cause and Effect" is a dangerous one,so long as people
believe in something thatcauses,and a something that iscaused.(a)Necessity is not an established fact, but an interpretation.***(b)When it is understood that the "subject" is nothing thatacts,but only a thing of fancy, there is much that follows.Only with the subject as model we inventedthingnessand read it into
the pell-mell of sensations. If we cease from believing in theactingsubject, the belief inactingthings, in reciprocal action, in cause
and effect between phenomena which we call things, also falls to pieces.In this case the world ofacting atomsalso disappears: for this
world is always assumed to exist on the pre-determined grounds that
subjects are necessary.Ultimately, of course,the "thing-in-itself"also disappears: for
at bottom it is the conception of a "subject-in-itself." But we
have seen that the subject is an imaginary thing. The antithesis
"thing-in-itself" and "appearance" is untenable; but in this way the
concept "appearance" also disappears.***(c)If we abandon the idea of the actingsubject,we also abandon
theobjectacted upon. Duration, equality to self, Being, are
inherent neither in what is called subject, nor in what is called
object: they are complex phenomena, and in regard to other phenomena
are apparently durable—they aredistinguishable, for instance, by
the different tempo with which they happen (repose—movement, fixed
—loose: all antitheses which do not exist in themselves and by means
of whichdifferences of degreeonly are expressed; from a certain
limited point of view, though, they seem to be antitheses. There are no
such things as antitheses; it is from logic that we derive our concept
of contrasts—and starting out from its standpoint we spread the error
over all things).***(d)If we abandon the ideas "subject" and "object"; then we must also
abandon the idea"substance"—and therefore its various modifications
too; for instance: "matter," "spirit," and other hypothetical things,
"eternity and the immutability of matter," etc. We are then rid ofmateriality.***From a moral standpointthe world is false.But inasmuch as morality
itself is a part of this world, morality also is false. The will
to truth is a process ofestablishing things, it is a process ofmakingthings true and lasting, a total elimination of thatfalsecharacter, a transvaluation of it intobeing.Thus, "truth" is not
something which is present and which has to be found and discovered; it
is somethingwhich has to be createdand whichgivesits nameto a
process,or, better still, to the Will to overpower, which in itself
has no purpose: to introduce truth is aprocessus in infinitum,anactive determining—it is not a process ofbecoming conscious of
something, which in itself is fixed and determined. It is merely a word
for "The Will to Power."Life is based on the hypothesis of a belief in stable and regularly
recurring things, the mightier it is, the more vast must be the world
of knowledge and the world called being. Logicising, rationalising, and
systematising are of assistance as means of existence.Man projects his instinct of truth, his "aim," to a certain extent
beyond himself, in the form of a metaphysical world of Being, a
"thing-in-itself," a world already to hand. His requirements as a
creator make himinventthe world in which he works in advance; he
anticipates it: this anticipation (this faith in truth) is his mainstay.***All phenomena, movement, Becoming, regarded as the establishment of
relations of degree and of force, as a contest....***As soon as wefancythat some one is responsible for the fact that
we are thus and thus, etc. (God, Nature), and that we ascribe our
existence, our happiness, our misery, ourdestiny,to that some one,
we corrupt theinnocence of Becomingfor ourselves. We then have some
one who wishes to attain to something by means of us and with us.***The "welfare of the individual" is just as fanciful as the "welfare
of the species": the first isnotsacrificed to the last; seen
from afar, the speciesis just as fluid as the individual. "Thepreservationof the species" is only a result of thegrowthof the
species—that is to say,of the overcoming of the specieson the road
to a stronger kind.***Theses:—The apparent conformity of means to end ("the conformity of
means to end which far surpasses the art of man) is merely the result
of that "Will to Power" which manifests itself in all phenomena:—To
become strongerinvolves a process of ordering, which may well be
mistaken for an attempted conformity of means to end:—Theendswhich
are apparent are not intended but, as soon as a superior power prevails
over an inferior power, and the latter proceeds to work as a function
of the former, an order ofrankis established, an organisation which
must give rise to the idea that there is an arrangement of means and
ends.Against apparent "necessity":—This is only an expression for the fact that a certain power is not
also something else.Against the apparent conformity of means to ends":—The latter is only anexpressionfor the order among the spheres of
power and their interplay.(i)The Thing-in-Itself and Appearance.553.The foul blemish on Kant's criticism has at last become visible
even to the coarsest eyes: Kanthad no right to his distinction
"appearance" and "thing-in-itself,"—in his own writings he had
deprived himself of the right of differentiating any longer in this
old and hackneyed manner, seeing that he had condemned the practice of
drawing any conclusions concerning the cause of an appearance from the
appearance itself, as unallowable in accordance with his conception
of the idea of causality and itspurely intraphenomenalvalidity,
and this conception, on the other hand, already anticipates thatdifferentiation,as if the "thing in itself" were not only inferred
but actuallygiven.554.It is obvious that neither things-in-themselvesnorappearances can
be related to each other in the form of cause and effect: and from this
it follows that the concept "cause and effect" isnot applicablein a
philosophy which believes in things-in-themselves and in appearances.
Kant's mistake—... As a matter of fact, from a psychological
standpoint, the concept "cause and effect" is derived from an attitude
of mind which believes it sees the action of will upon will everywhere,
which believes only in living things, and at bottom only in souls (not
in things). Within the mechanical view of the world (which is logic
and its application to space and time) that concept is reduced to
the mathematical formula with which—and this is a fact which cannot
be sufficiently emphasised—nothing is ever understood, but ratherdefined—deformed.555.The greatest of all fables is the one relating to knowledge. People
would like to know how things-in-themselves are constituted: but
behold, there are no things-in-themselves! But even supposing therewerean "in-itself," an unconditional thing, it could on that very
accountnot be known! Something unconditioned cannot be known:
otherwise it would not be unconditioned! Knowing, however, is always a
process of "coming into relation with something"; the knowledge-seeker,
on this principle, wants the thing, which he would know, to be nothing
to him, and to be nothing to anybody at all: and from this there
results a contradiction,—in the first place, between thiswillto
know, and this desire that the thing to be knownshouldbe nothing
to him (wherefore know at all then?); and secondly, because something
which is nothing to anybody, does not evenexist,and therefore
cannot be known. Knowing means: "to place one's self in relation with
something," to feel one's self conditioned by something and one's
self conditioning it under all circumstances, then, it is a process
ofmaking stable or fixed,ofdefining,ofmaking conditions
conscious(not a process ofsoundingthings, creatures, or objects
in-themselves).556.A "thing-in-itself" is just as absurd as a "sense-in-itself," a
"meaning-in-itself." There is no suchthing as a "fact-in-itself,"for a meaning must always be given to it before it can become a fact.The answer to the question, "What is that?" is a process offixing a
meaningfrom a different standpoint. The "essence" the "essential
factor," is something which is only seen as a whole in perspective,
and which presupposes a basis which is multifarious. Fundamentally the
question is "What is that for me?" (for us, for everything that lives,
etc. etc.).A thing would be defined when all creatures had asked and answered this
question, "What is that?" concerning it. Supposing that one single
creature, with its own relations and standpoint in regard to all
things, were lacking, that thing would still remain undefined.In short: the essence of a thing is really only anopinionconcerning
that "thing." Or, better still; "it is worth" is actually what is
meant by"it is"or by "that is."One may not ask: "Whointerprets, then?" for the act of interpretingitselfas a form of the Will to Power, manifests itself (not as
"Being," but as aprocess,asBecoming) as a passion.The origin of "things" is wholly the work of the idealising, thinking,
willing, and feeling subject. The concept thing as well as all its
attributes.—Even "the subject" is a creation of this order, a "thing"
like all others: a simplification, aiming at a definition of thepowerthat fixes, invents, and thinks, as such, as distinct from
all isolated fixing, inventing, and thinking. Thus a capacity defined
or distinct from all other individual capacities; atbottom action
conceived collectively in regard to all the action which has yet to
come (action and the probability of similar action).557.The qualities of a thing are its effects upon other "things."If one imagines other "things" to be non-existent, a thing has no
qualities.That is to say;there is nothing without other things.That is to say; there is no "thing-in-itself."558.The thing-in-itself is nonsense. If I think all the "relations," all
the "qualities" all the "activities" of a thing, away, the thing itself
doesnotremain: for "thingness" was onlyinvented fancifullyby
us to meet certain logical needs—that is to say, for the purposes of
definition and comprehension (in order to correlate that multitude of
relations, qualities, and activities).559."Things which have a naturein themselves"—a dogmatic idea, which
must be absolutely abandoned.560.That things should have anature in themselves,quite apart from
interpretation and subjectivity,is a perfectly idle hypothesis:
it would presupposethatinterpretationand theact of being
subjectiveare not essential, that a thing divorced from all its
relations can still be a thing.Or, the other way round: the apparentobjectivecharacter of things;
might it not be merely the result of adifference of degreewithin
the subject perceiving?—could not that which changes slowly strike
us as being objective, lasting, Being, "in-itself"?—could not the
objective view be only a false way of conceiving things and a contrastwithinthe perceiving subject?561.If all unity were only unity as organisation. But the "thing" in
which we believe wasinventedonly as a substratum to the various
attributes. If the thing "acts," it means: we regardall the otherqualities which are to hand, and which are momentarily latent, as
the cause accounting for the fact that one individual quality steps
forward—that is to say,we take the sum of its qualities—x—as
the cause of the qualityx; which is obviouslyquiteabsurd and
imbecile!All unity isonly soin the form oforganisationandcollective
action:in the same way as a human community is a unity—that is to
say,the reverse ofatomicanarchy; thus it is a body politic,
whichstands forone, yetisnot one.562."At some time in the development of thought, a point must have been
reached when man became conscious of the fact that what he calledthequalities of a thingwere merely the sensations of the feeling
subject: and thus the qualities ceased from belonging to the thing."
The "thing-in-itself" remained over. 'The distinction between the
thing-in-itself and the thing-for-us, is based upon that older and
artless observation which would fain grant energy to things: but
analysis revealed that even force was only ascribed to them by our
fancy, as was also—substance. "The thing affects a subject?" Thus the
root of the idea of substance is in language, not in things outside
ourselves! The thing-in-itself is not a problem at all!Being will have to be conceived as a sensation which is no longer based
upon anything quite devoid of sensation.In movement no newmeaningis given to feeling. That which is, cannot
be the substance of movement: it is therefore a form of Being.N.B.—The explanation of life may be sought, in the first
place, through mental images of phenomena whichprecedeit
(purposes);Secondly, through mental images of phenomena which follow
behind it (the mathematico-physical explanation).The two should not be confounded. Thus: the physical explanation, which
is the symbolisation of the world by means of feeling and thought,
cannot in itself make feeling and thinking originate again and show
its derivation: physics must rather construct the world of feeling,
consistentlywithout feeling or purposeright up to the highest man.
And teleology is only ahistory of purposes,and is never physical.563.Our method of acquiring "knowledge" is limited to a process of
establishingquantities,but we can by no means help feeling the
difference of quantity as differences ofquality.Quality is merely arelativetruth forus; it is not a "thing-in-itself."Our senses have a certain definite quantum as a mean, within the limits
of which they perform their functions—that is to say, we become
conscious of bigness and smallness in accordance with the conditions of
our existence. If we sharpened or blunted our senses tenfold, we should
perish—that is to say, we feel evenproportionsasqualitiesin
regard to our possibilities of existence.564.But could not allquantitiesbe merely tokens ofqualities? Another
consciousness and scale of desires must correspond to greater power
in fact, another point of view; growth in itself is the expression of
a desireto become more;the desire for a greaterquantumsprings
from a certainquale,in a purely quantitative world, everything
would be dead, stiff, and motionless.—The reduction of all qualities
to quantities is nonsense: it is discovered that they can only stand
together, an analogy—565.Qualities are our insurmountable barriers; we cannot possibly help
feeling meredifferences of quantityas something fundamentally
different from quantity—that is to say, asqualities,which wecan
no longer reduce to terms of quantity. But everything in regard to
which the word "knowledge" has any sense at all, belongs to the realm
of reckoning, weighing, and measuring, to quantity whereas, conversely,
all our valuations (that is to say, our sensations) belong precisely to
the realm of qualities,i.e.to those truths which belong to us alone
and to our point of view, and which absolutely cannot be "known." It is
obvious that every one of us, different creatures, must feel different
qualities, and must therefore live in a different world from the rest.
Qualities are an idiosyncrasy proper to human nature; the demand that
these our human interpretations and values, should be general and
perhaps real values, belongs to the hereditary madnesses of human pride.566.The "real world," in whatever form it has been conceived hitherto—was
always the world of appearanceover again.567.The world of appearance,i.e.a world regarded in the light of
values; ordered, selected according to values—that is to say, in
this case, according to the standpoint of utility in regard to the
preservation and the increase of power of a certain species of animals.It isthe point of view,then, which accounts for the character of
"appearance." As if a world could remain over, when the point of view
is cancelled! By such meansrelativitywould also be cancelled!Every centre of energy has itspoint of viewof the whole of theremainderof the world—that is to say, its perfectly definitevaluation,its mode of action, its mode of resistance. The "world of
appearance" is thus reduced to a specific kind of action on the world
proceeding from a centre.But there is no other kind of action: and the "world" is only a word
for the collective play of these actions.Realityconsists precisely
in this particular action and reaction of every isolated factor against
the whole.There no longer remains a shadow of arightto speak here of
"appearance." ...Thespecific way of reactingis the only way of reacting; we do not
know how many kinds and what sort of kinds there are.But there is no "other," no "real," no essential being,—for thus a
worldwithoutaction and reaction would be expressed....The antithesis: world of appearance and real world, is thus reduced to
the antitheses "world" and "nonentity."568.A criticism of the concept "real and apparentworld."—Of these two
the first is a mere fiction, formed out of a host of imaginary things.Appearance itself belongs to reality: it is a form of its being;i.e.in a world where there is no such thing as being, a certain calculable
world ofidenticalcases must first be created throughappearance;atempoin which observation and comparison is possible, etc."Appearance" is an adjusted and simplified world, in which ourpracticalinstincts have worked: for us it is perfectly true: for welivein it, we can live in it:this is the proofof its truth as
far as we are concerned....The world, apart from the fact that we have to live in it—the
world, which we havenotadjusted to our being, our logic, and our
psychological prejudices—doesnotexist as a world "in-itself"; it
is essentially a world of relations: under certain circumstances it has
adifferent aspectfrom every different point at which it is seen:
it presses against every point, and every point resists it—and these
collective relations are in every caseincongruent.Themeasure of powerdetermines whatbeingpossesses the other
measure of power: under what form, force, or constraint, it acts or
resists.Our particular case is interesting enough: we have created a conception
in order to be able to live in a world, in order to perceive just
enough to enable us toendurelife in that world....569.The nature of our psychological vision is determined by the fact—(1) Thatcommunicationis necessary, and that for communication
to be possible something must be stable, simplified, and capable of
being stated precisely (above all, in the so-calledidenticalcase).
In order that it may be communicable, it must be felt as somethingadjusted,as "recognisable." The material of the senses, arranged
by the understanding,reduced to coarse leading features, made similar
to other things, and classified with its like. Thus: the indefiniteness
and the chaos of sense-impressions are, as it were,made logical.(2) Thephenomenalworld is the adjusted world whichwe believe
to be real,Its "reality" lies in the constant return of similar,
familiar, and related things, in theirrationalised character,and in
the belief that we are here able to reckon and determine.(3) The opposite of this phenomenal world is not "the real world,"
but the amorphous and unadjustable world consisting of the chaos of
sensations—that is to say,another kindof phenomenal; world, a
world which to us is "unknowable."(4) The question how things-in-themselves are constituted, quite apart
from our sense-receptivity and from the activity of our understanding,
must be answered by the further question: how were we able to knowthat things existed?"Thingness" is one of our own inventions. The
question is whether there are not a good many more ways of creating
such a world of appearance—and whether this creating, rationalising,
adjusting, and falsifying be not the best-guaranteedrealityitself:
in short, whether that which "fixes the meaning of things" is not
the only reality: and whether the "effect of environment upon us"
be not merely the result of such will-exercising subjects.... The
other "creatures" act upon us; ouradjustedworld of appearance
is an arrangement and anoverpoweringof its activities: a sort
ofdefensivemeasure.The subject alone is demonstrable;
thehypothesismight be advancedthat subjects are all that
exist,—that"object" is only a form of action of subject upon
subject ... amodus of the subject.(k)The Metaphysical Need.570.If one resembles all the philosophers that have gone before, one
can have no eyes for what has existed and what will exist—one sees
only whatis.But as there is no such thing as Being; all that the
philosophers had to deal with was a host offancies,this was their
"world."571.To assert theexistenceas a whole of things concerning which we know
nothing, simply because there is an advantage in not being able to know
anything of them, was a piece of artlessness on Kant's part, and the
result of the recoil-stroke of certain needs—especially in the realm
of morals and metaphysics.572.An artist cannot endure reality; he turns away or back from it: his
earnest opinion is that the worth of a thing consists in that nebulous
residue of it which one derives from colour, form, sound, and thought;
he believes that the more subtle, attenuated, and volatile, a thing
or a man becomes,the more valuable he becomes: the less real,the
greater the worth. This is Platonism: but Plato was guilty of yet
further audacity in the matter ofturning tables—he measured the
degree of reality according to the degree of value, and said: The more
there is of "idea" the more there is of Being. He twisted the concept
"reality" round and said: "What ye regard as real is an error, and the
nearer we get to the 'idea' the nearer we are to 'truth.'"—Is this
understood? It was thegreatest of all rechristenings:and because
Christianity adopted it, we are blind to its astounding features. At
bottom, Plato, like the artist he was,placed appearance beforeBeing! and therefore lies and fiction before truth! unreality before
actuality!—He was, however, so convinced of the value of appearance,
that he granted it the attributes of "Being," "causality," "goodness,"
and "truth," and, in short, all those things which are associated with
value.The concept value itself regarded as a cause: first standpoint.The ideal granted all attributes, conferring honour: second standpoint.573.The idea of the "true world" or of "God" as absolutely spiritual,
intellectual, and good, is anemergency measureto the extent to
which theantagonisticinstincts are all-powerful....Moderation and existing humanity is reflected exactly in the
humanisation of the gods. The Greeks of the strongest period, who
entertained no fear whatever of themselves, but on the contrary were
pleased with themselves, brought down their gods to all their emotions.The spiritualisation of the idea of God is thus very far from being a
sign ofprogress: one is heartily conscious of this when one reads
Goethe—in his works the vaporisation of God into virtue and spirit is
felt as being upon a lower plane.574.The nonsense of all metaphysics shown to reside in the derivation of
the conditioned out of the unconditioned.It belongs to the nature of thinking that it adds the unconditioned to
the conditioned, that it invents it—just as it thought of and invented
the "ego" to cover the multifariousness of its processes i it measures
the world according to a host of self-devised measurements—according
to its fundamental fictions "the unconditioned," "end and means,"
"things," "substances," and according to logical laws, figures, and
forms.There would be nothing which could be called knowledge, if thought did
not first sore-createthe world into "things" which are in its own
image. It is onlythroughthought that there isuntruth.Theoriginof thought, like that offeelings,cannot be traced:
but that isnoproof of its primordiality or absoluteness! It simply
shows that we cannot getbehind it,because we have nothing else save
thought and feeling.575.To know is topoint to past experience:in its nature it is aregressus in infinitum.That whichhalts (in the face of a so-calledcausa primaor the unconditioned, etc.) islaziness,weariness.576.Concerning the psychology of metaphysics—the influence of fear. That
which has been most feared, the cause of thegreatest suffering(lust
of power, voluptuousness, etc.), has been treated with the greatest
amount of hostility by men, and eliminated from the "real" world. Thus
thepassionshave been step by stepstruck out,God posited as
the opposite of evil—that is to say, reality is conceived to be thenegation of the passions and the emotions(i.e.nonentity).Irrationality,impulsive action, accidental action, is, moreover,
hated by them (as the cause of incalculable suffering).Consequentlythey denied this element in the absolute, and interpreted it as
absolute "rationality" and "conformity of means to ends."Changeandperishabilitywere also feared; and by this fear an
oppressed soul is revealed, full of distrust and painful experiences
(the case withSpinoza: a man differently constituted would have
regarded this change as a charm).A nature overflowing andplayingwith energy, would call precisely
thepassions, irrationalityandchange, goodin a eudemonistic
sense, together with their consequences: danger, contrast, ruin, etc.577.Against the value of that which always remains the same (remember
Spinoza's artlessness andDescartes' likewise), the value of the
shortest and of the most perishable, the seductive flash of gold on the
belly of the serpentvita——578.Moral values in epistemology itself:—The faith in reason—why not mistrust?The "real world" is the good world—why?Appearance, change, contradiction, struggle, regarded as
immoral: the desire for a world whichknows nothingof
these things.The transcendental world discovered,so thata place may
be kept for "moral freedom" (as in Kant).Dialectics as the road to virtue (in Plato and Socrates:
probably because sophistry was held to be the road to
immorality).Time and space are ideal: consequently there is unity in
the essence of things; consequently no sin, no evil, no
imperfection, ajustificationof God.Epicurusdeniedthe possibility of knowledge, in order to
keep the moral (particularly the hedonistic) values as the
highest.Augustine does the same, and later Pascal ("corrupted
reason"), in favour of Christian values.Descartes' contempt for everything variable; likewise
Spinoza's.579.Concerning the psychology of metaphysics.—This world is only
apparent:thereforethere must be areal world;—this world is
conditioned:consequentlythere must be an unconditioned world;—this
world is contradictory:consequentlythere is a world free from
contradiction;—this world is evolving:consequentlythere is
somewhere a static world:—a host of false conclusions (blind faith
in reason: if A exists, then its opposite B must alsoexist). Paininspires these conclusions: at bottom they arewithesthat such
a world might exist; the hatred of a world which leads to suffering
is likewise revealed by the fact that another andbetterworld is
imagined: theresentmentof the metaphysician against reality is
creative here.The secondseries of questions:whereforesuffer? ... and from
this a conclusion is derived concerning the relation of the real
world to our apparent, changing, suffering, and contradictory world:
(1) Suffering as the consequence of error: how is error possible?
(2) Suffering as the consequence of guilt: how is guilt possible?
(A host of experiences drawn from the sphere of nature or society,
universalised and made absolute.) But if the conditioned world be
causally determined by the unconditioned, then thefreedom to err, to
be sinful,must also be derived from the same quarter: and once more
the question arises,to what purpose?... The world of appearance, of
Becoming, of contradiction, of suffering, is thereforewilled; to what
purpose?The error of these conclusions; two contradictory concepts are
formed—because one of them corresponds to a reality, the other
"must" also correspond to a reality. "Whence" would one otherwisederive its contradictory concept?Reasonis thus a source of
revelation concerning the absolute.But theoriginof the above contradictionsneed not necessarilybe
a supernatural source of reason: it is sufficient to oppose the real
genesisof the concepts, this springs from practical spheres, from
utilitarian spheres, hence thestrong faithit commands(one is
threatened with ruinif one's conclusions are not in conformity with
this reason; but this fact is no "proof" of what the latter asserts).The preoccupation of metaphysicians with pain,is quite artless.
"Eternal blessedness": psychological nonsense. Brave and creative men
never make pleasure and pain ultimate questions—they are incidental
conditions: both of them must be desired when onewill attain tosomething. It is a sign of fatigue and illness in these metaphysicians
and religious men, that they should press questions of pleasure and
pain into the foreground. Evenmoralityin their eyes derives its
great importanceonlyfrom the fact that it is regarded as an
essential condition for abolishing pain.The same holds good of the preoccupation with appearance and errorthe cause of pain. A superstition that happiness and truth are related
(confusion: happiness in "certainty," in "faith").580.To what extent are the variousepistemological positions(materialism, sensualism, idealism) consequences of valuations? The
source of the highestfeelings of pleasure ("feelings of value") may
also judge concerning the problem ofreality!The measure ofpositive knowledgeis quite a matter of indifference
and beside the point; as witness the development of Indici.The Buddhisticnegationof reality in general (appearance pain) is
perfectly consistent: undemonstrability, inaccessibility, lack of
categories, not only for an "absolute world," but a recognition of
theerroneous proceduresby means of which the whole concept has
been reached. "Absolute reality," "Being in itself," a contradiction.
In a world ofBecoming,reality is merely asimplificationfor
the purpose of practical ends, or adeceptionresulting from the
coarseness of certain organs, or a variation in the tempo of Becoming.The logical denial of the world and Nihilism is a consequence of the
fact that we must oppose nonentity with Being, and that Becoming is
denied. ("Something" becomes.)581.BeingandBecoming.—"Reason" developed upon a sensualistic basis
upon theprejudices of the senses—that is to say, with the belief in
the truth of the judgment of the senses."Being," as the generalisation of the concept "Life" (breath), "to be
animate," "to will," "to act upon," "become."The opposite is: "to be inanimate," "notto become," "notto will."Thus: "Being" isnotopposed to "not-Being," to "appearance," nor
isit opposed to death (for only that can be dead which can also live).The "soul," the "ego," posited asprimeval facts;and introduced
whereverthere is Becoming.582.Being—we have no other idea of it than that which we derive from
"living."—How then can everything "be" dead?583.A.I see with astonishment that science resigns itself to-day to the fate
of being reduced to the world of appearance: we certainly have no organ
of knowledge for the real world—be it what it may.At this point we may well ask: With what organ of knowledge is this
contradiction established?...The fact that a world which is accessible to our organs is also
understood to be dependent upon these organs, and the fact that we
should understand a world as subjectively conditioned, arenoproofs
of the actualpossibilityof an objective world. Who urges us to
believe that subjectivityisreal or essential?The absolute is even an absurd concept: an "absolute mode of existence"
is nonsense, the concept "being," "thing," is alwaysrelativeto us.The trouble is that, owing to the old antithesis "apparent" and "real,"
the correlative valuations "of little value" and "absolutely valuable"
have been spread abroad.The world of appearance does not strike us as a "valuable" world;
appearance is on a lower plane than the highest value. Only a "real"
world can be absolutely "valuable"....Prejudice of prejudices!It is perfectly possible in itself that
the real nature of things would be so unfriendly, so opposed to the
first conditions of life, that appearance is necessary in order to
make life possible.... This is certainly the case in a large number of
situations—for instance, marriage.Our empirical world would thus be conditioned, even in its limits
to knowledge, by the instinct of self-preservation, we regard that
as good, valuable, and true, which favours the preservation of the
species....(a)We have no categories which allow us to distinguish between a
real and an apparent world. (At the most, there could exist a world of
appearance, but notourworld of appearance.)(b)Taking therealworld for granted, it might still be theless
valuableto us; for the quantum of illusion might be of the highest
order, owing to its value to us as a preservative measure. (Unlessappearancein itself were sufficient to condemn anything?)(c)That there exists a correlation between thedegrees of valueand thedegrees of reality(so that the highest values also possessed
the greatestdegree of reality), is a metaphysical postulate which
starts out with the hypothesis that weknowthe order of rank among
values; and that this order is amoralone. It is only on this
hypothesis thattruthis necessary as a definition of all that is of
a superior value.B.It is of cardinal importance that thereal worldshould be
suppressed. It is the most formidable inspirer of doubts, and
depredator of values, concerning theworld which we are: it was our
most dangerousattemptheretofore on the life of Life.Waragainst all the hypotheses upon which a real world has been
imagined. The notion thatmoral valuesare thehighestvalues,
belongs to this hypothesis.The superiority of the moral valuation would be refuted, if it could
be shown to be the result of animmoralvaluation—a specific case
of real immorality: it would thus reduce itself to anappearance,and as anappearanceit would cease from having any right to condemn
appearance.C.Then the "Will to Truth" would have to be examined psychologically: it
is not a moral power, but a form of the Will to Power. This would have
to be proved by the fact that it avails itself of everyimmoralmeans
there is; above all, of the metaphysicians.At the present moment we are face to face with the necessity of testing
the assumption that moral values are the highest values,Method in
researchis attained only when allmoral prejudiceshave been
overcome: it represents a conquest over morality....584.The aberrations of philosophy are the outcome of the fact that,
instead of recognising in logic and the categories of reason merely
a means to the adjustment of the world for utilitarian ends (that is
to say, especially, a usefulfalsification), they were taken to be
the criterion of truth—particularly ofreality.The "criterion
of truth" was, as a matter of fact, merely thebiological utility
of a systematic falsification of this sort, on principle:and,
since a species of animals knows nothing more important than its own
preservation, it was indeed allowable here to speak of "truth." Where
the artlessness came in, however, was in taking this anthropocentric
idiosyncrasy as themeasure of things,as the canon for recognising
the "real" and the "unreal": in short, in making a relative thing
absolute. And behold, all at once, the world fell into the two halves,
"real" and "apparent": and precisely that world which man's reason had
arranged for him to live and to settle in, was discredited. Instead of
using the forms as mere instruments for making the world manageable
and calculable, the mad fancy of philosophers intervened, and saw that
in these categories the concept of that world is given whichdoes
not correspond to the concept of the world in which man lives.... The
means were misunderstood as measures of value, and even used as a
condemnation of their original purpose....The purpose was, to deceive one's self in a useful way: the means
thereto was the invention of forms and signs, with the help of which
the confusing multifariousness of life could be reduced to a useful and
wieldy scheme.But woe! amoral categorywas now brought into the game: no creature
would deceive itself, no creature may deceive itself—consequently
there is only a will to truth. What is "truth"?The principle of contradiction provided the scheme: the real world to
which the way is being sought cannot be in contradiction with itself,
cannot change, cannot evolve, has no beginning and no end.That is the greatest error which has ever been committed, the really
fatal error of the world: it was believed that in the forms of reason a
criterion of reality had been found—whereas their only purpose was to
master reality, bymisunderstandingit intelligently....And behold, the world became false precisely owing to the qualitieswhich constitute its reality,namely, change, evolution,
multifariousness, contrast, contradiction, war. And thenceforward the
whole fatality was there.1. How does one get rid of the false and merely apparent world? (it was
the real and only one).2. How does one become one's self as remoteas possible from the
world of appearance? (the concept of the perfect being as a contrast
to the real being; or, more correctly still, asthe contradiction of
life....).The whole direction of values was towards theslander of life; people
deliberately confounded ideal dogmatism with knowledge in general: so
that the opposing parties also began to rejectsciencewith horror.Thus the road to science wasdoublybarred: first, by the belief
in the real world; and secondly, by the opponents of this belief.
Natural science and psychology were (1) condemned in their objects, (2)
deprived of their artlessness....Everything is so absolutely bound and related to everything else in
the real world, that to condemn, or tothink awayanything, means to
condemn and think away the whole. The words "this should not be," "this
ought not to be," are a farce.... If one imagines the consequences,
one would ruin the very source of Life by suppressing everything which
is in any sense whateverdangerous or destructive.Physiology proves
thismuch better!We see how morality(a) poisonsthe whole concept of the world,(b)cuts off the way toscience, (c)dissipates and undermines all real
instincts (by teaching that their root isimmoral).We thus perceive a terrible tool of decadence at work, which succeeds
in remaining immune, thanks to the holy names and holy attitudes it
assumes.585.The awful recovery of ourconsciousness:not of the individual, but
of the human species. Let us reflect; let us think backwards; let us
follow the narrow and broad highway.A.Man seeks "the truth": a world that does not contradict itself,
that does not deceive, that does not change, arealworld—a
world in which there is no suffering: contradiction, deception,
variability—-the causes of suffering! He does not doubt that there is
such a thing as a world as it ought to be; he would fain find a road to
it. (Indian criticism: even the ego is apparent andnotreal.)Whence does man derive the concept ofreality? —Why does he make
variability, deception, contradiction, the origin ofsuffering;why
not rather of his happiness? ...The contempt and hatred of all that perishes, changes, and varies:
whence comes this valuation of stability? Obviously, the will to truth
ismerelythe longing for astable world.The senses deceive; reason corrects the errors:therefore,it was
concluded, reason is the road to a static state; the mostspiritualideas must be nearest to the "real world."—It is from the senses that
the greatest number of misfortunes come they are cheats, deluders, and
destroyers.Happiness can be promised only by Being: change and happiness exclude
each other. Theloftiest desire is thus to be one with Being. That is
the formula for the way to happiness.In summa:The world as itoughtto be exists; this world in which
we live is an error—this our world shouldnotexist.The belief in Beingshows itself only as a result: the real primummobileis the disbelief in Becoming, the mistrust of Becoming, the
scorn of all Becoming....What kind of a man reflects in this way? An unfruitful,sufferingkind, a world-weary kind. If we try and fancy what the opposite kind
of man would be like, we have a picture of a creature who would not
require the belief in Being; he would rather despise it as dead,
tedious, and indifferent....The belief that the world which ought to be, is, really exists, is a
belief proper to the unfruitful,who do not wish to create a world as
it should be.They take it for granted, they seek for means and ways
of attaining to it. "The will to truth"—is the impotence of the will
to create.To recognise that something}Antagonism inisthusorthus:}the degrees ofTo act so that something will}energy inbethusorthus:}various natures.The fiction of a world which corresponds to our desires; psychological
artifices and interpretations calculated to associate all that we
honour and regard as pleasant, with thisreal world."The will to truth" at this stage is essentiallythe art of
interpretation:to which also belongs that interpretation which still
possesses strength.The same species of men, grown one degree poorer,no longer possessed
of the powerto interpret and to create fictions, produces the
Nihilists.A Nihilist is the man who says of the world as it is,
that it oughtnotto exist, and of the world as it ought to be, that
it does not exist. According to this, existence (action, suffering,
willing, and feeling) has no sense: the pathos of the "in vain" is the
Nihilist's pathos—and as pathos it is moreover aninconsistencyon
the part of the Nihilist.He who is not able to introduce his will into things, the man without
either will or energy, at least invests them with some meaning,i.e.he believes that a will is already in them.The degree of a man'swill-powermay be measured from the extent to
which he can dispense with the meaning in things, from the extent to
which he is able to endure a world without meaning:because he himself
arranges a small portion of it.Thephilosophical objective view of thingsmay thus be a sign of
poverty both of will and of energy. For energy organises what is
closest and next; the "scientists," whose only desire is toascertainwhat exists, are such as cannot arrange thingsas they ought to be.Theartists,an intermediary species, they at least set up a symbol
of what should exist,—they are productive inasmuch as they actuallyalterand transform; not like the scientists, who leave everything as
it is.The connection between philosophers and the pessimistic religions;the same species of man(they attribute the highest degree of
realityto thethings which are valued highest).The connection between philosophers and moral menand their
evaluations (themoralinterpretation of the world as the sense of
the world: after the collapse of the religious sense).The overcoming of philosophersby the annihilation of the world of
being: intermediary period of Nihilism; before there is sufficient
strength present to transvalue values, and to make the world of
becoming, and of appearance, theonlyworld to be deified and called
good.B.Nihilism as a normal phenomenon may be a symptom of increasingstrengthor of increasingweakness:—Partly owing to the fact that the strengthto createandto willhas grown to such an extent, that it no longer requires this collective
interpretation and introduction of asense("present duties," state,
etc.);Partly owing to the fact that even the creative power necessary
to invent sense, declines, and disappointment becomes the ruling
condition. The inability tobelievein a sense becomes "unbelief."What is the meaning ofsciencein regard to both possibilities?(1) It is a sign of strength and self-control; it shows anabilityto
dispense with healing, consoling worlds of illusion.(2) It is also able to undermine, to dissect, to disappoint, and to
weaken.C.The belief in truth,the need of holding to something which is
believed to be true: psychological reduction apart from the valuations
that have existed hitherto. Fear and laziness.At the same timeunbelief:Reduction. In what way does it acquire anew value,if a real world does not exist at all (by this means the
capacity of valuing, which hitherto has beenlavishedupon the world
of being, becomes free once more).586.Therealand the"apparent" world.A.Theerroneous conceptswhich proceed from this concept are of three
kinds:—(a)An unknown world:—we are adventurers, we are inquisitive,—that
which is known to us makes us weary (the danger of the concept lies in
the fact it suggests that "this" world is known to us....);(b) Anotherworld, where things are different:—something in us draws
comparisons, and thereby our calm submission and our silence lose their
value—perhaps all will be for the best, we have not hoped in vain....
The world where things are different—who knows?—where we ourselves
will be different....(c)Arealworld:—that is the most singularblow and attack
which we have ever received; so many things have become encrusted in
the word "true," that we involuntarily give these to the "real world";
therealworld must also be atruthfulworld, such a one as would
not deceive us or make fools of us; to believe in it in this way is to
be almostforcedto believe (from convention, as is the case among
people worthy of confidence).***The concept, "theunknownworld," suggests that this world is known
to us (is tedious);The concept, "the other world," suggests that this worldmight be
different,it suppresses necessity and fate (it is useless tosubmitand toadapt one's self);The concept,the true world,suggests that this world is
untruthful, deceitful, dishonest, not genuine, and not essential,
andconsequentlynot a world calculated to be useful to us (it is
unadvisable to become adapted to it;betterresist it).***Thus weescapefrom "this" world in three different ways:——(a)With ourcuriosity—as though the interesting part was
somewhere else;(b)With oursubmission—as though it was not necessary to submit,
as though this world was not an ultimate necessity;(c)With oursympathyand respect—as though this world did not
deserve them, as though it was mean and dishonest towards us....In summa: we have become revolutionaries inthree different ways; we
have madexour criticism of the "known world."B.The first step to reason:to understand to what extent we have beenseduced,—for it might bepreciselythe reverse:(a)Theunknownworld could be so constituted as to give us a
liking for "this" world—it may be a more stupid and meaner form of
existence.(b)The other world, very far from taking account of our desires
which were never realised here, might be part of the mass of things
whichthisworld makes possible for us; to learn to know this world
would be a means of satisfying us,(c)Thetrueworld: but who actually says that the apparent world
must be of less value than the true world? Do not our instincts
contradict this judgment? Is not man eternally occupied in creating an
imaginative world, because he will have a better world than reality?In the first place,how do we know thatourworld isnotthe
true world? ... for it might be that the other world is the world of
"appearance" (as a matter of fact, the Greeks, for instance, actually
imagined aregion of shadows, a life of appearance,besiderealexistence). And finally, what right have we to establishdegrees of
reality,as it were? That is something different from an unknown
world—that is already thewill to know something of the unknown.The
"other," the "unknown" world—good! but to speak of the "true world" is
asgood as "knowingsomething about it,"—that is thecontraryof
the assumption of anx-world....In short, the worldxmight be in every way a more tedious, a more
inhuman, and a less dignified world than this one.It would be quite another matter if it were assumed that there were
severalx-worlds—that is to say, every possible kind of world
besides our own. But this hasnever been assumed....C.Problem: why has theimage of the other worldalways been to the
disadvantage of "this" one—that is to say, always stood as a criticism
of it; what does this point to?—A people that are proud of themselves, and who are on the ascending
path of Life, always; pictureanotherexistence as lower and less
valuable than theirs; they regard the strange unknown world as their
enemy, as their opposite; they feel no curiosity, but rather repugnance
in regard to what is strange to them.... Such a body of men would never
admit that another people were the "true people"....The very fact that such a distinction is possible,—that this world
should be called the world of appearance, and that the other should be
called the true world,—is symptomatic.The places of origin of the idea, of "another world":The philosopher who invents a rational world wherereasonand logical functions areadequate:—this is the root of
the "true" world.The religious man who invents a "divine world";—this is the
root of the "denaturalised" and the "anti-natural" world.The moral man who invents a "free world":—this is the root
of the good, the perfect, the just, and the holy world.Thecommon factorin the three places of origin:psychologicalerror, physiological confusion.With what attributes is the "other world," as it actually appears in
history, characterised? With the stigmata of philosophical, religious,
and moral prejudices.The "other world" as it appears in the light of these facts, issynonymouswithnot-Being,with not-living, with thewillnot to
live....General aspect:it was the instinct of thefatigue of living,and
not that of life, which created the "other world."
