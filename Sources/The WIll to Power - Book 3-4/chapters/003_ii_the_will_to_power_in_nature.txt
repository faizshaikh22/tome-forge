Result:philosophy, religion, and morality aresymptoms of
decadence.(l)The Biological Value of Knowledge.587.It might seem as though I had evaded the question concerning
"certainty". The reverse is true: but while raising the question of the
criterion of certainty, I wished to discover the weights and measures
with which men had weighed heretofore—and to show that the questionconcerning certainty is already in itself adependentquestion, a
question of the second rank.588.The question of values is morefundamentalthan the question of
certainty: the latter only becomes serious once the question of values
has been answered.Being and appearance, regarded psychologically, yield no "Being in
itself," no criterion for reality, but only degrees of appearance,
measured according to the strength of the sympathy which we feel for
appearance.There is no struggle for existence between ideas and observations,
but only a struggle for supremacy—the vanquished idea isnot
annihilated,but onlydriven to the backgroundorsubordinated.
There is no such thing as annihilation in intellectual spheres.589."End and means""Cause and effect""Subject and object""Action and suffering""Thing-in-itself andappearance"As interpretations (notas established facts)—and in what respect
were they perhaps necessary interpretations? (as "preservative
measures")—all in the sense of a Will to Power.590.Our values areinterpreted into the heartof things.Is there, then, anysensein the absolute?Is not sense necessarilyrelative-senseand perspective?All sense is Will to Power (all relative senses may be identified with
it).591.The desire for "established facts"—Epistemology: how much pessimism
there is in it!592.The antagonism between the "true world," as pessimism depicts it, and
a world in which it were possible to live—for this the rights oftruthmust be tested. It is necessary to measure all these "ideal
forces" according to the standard of life, in order to understand the
nature of that antagonism: the struggle of sickly, desperate life,
cleaving to a beyond, against healthier, more foolish, more false,
richer, and fresher life. Thus it is not "truth" struggling with Life,
butonekind of Life with another kind.—But the former would fain
be thehigherkind!—Here we must prove that some order of rank is
necessary,—that the first problem isthe order of rank among kinds of
Life.593.The belief, "It isthusandthus," must be altered into the will,
"Thus and thusshall it be."(m)Science.594.Science hitherto has been a means of disposing of the confusion of
things by hypotheses which "explain everything"—that is to say, it
has been the result of the intellect's repugnance to chaos. This
same repugnance takes hold of me when I contemplatemyself;I
should like to form some kind of representation of my inner world
for myself by means of ascheme,and thus overcome intellectual
confusion. Morality was a simplification of this sort: it taught man asrecognised,asknown,—Now we have annihilated morality—we have
once more growncompletely obscureto ourselves! I know that I know
nothingabout myself. Physicsshows itself to be aboonfor the
mind: science (as the road toknowledge) acquires a new charm after
morality has been laid aside—andowing to the factthat we find
consistency here alone, we mustorderour lives in accordance with
it so that it may help us topreserve it.This results in a sort ofpractical meditationconcerning theconditions of our existenceas
investigators.595.Our first principles: no God: no purpose: limited energy. We will take
good care toavoidthinking out and prescribing the necessary lines
of thought for the lower orders.596.No "moraleducation" of humanity: but thedisciplinary school of
scientific errorsis necessary, because truth disgusts and creates a
dislike of life, provided a man is not already irrevocably launched
upon hisway,and bears the consequences of his honest standpoint
with tragic pride.597.The first principle ofscientific work:faith in the union and
continuance of scientific work, so that the individual may undertake to
work at any point, however small, and feel sure that his effortswill
not be in vain.There is a great paralysing force: to workin vain,to strugglein
vain.***The periods ofhoarding,when energy and power are stored, to be
utilised later by subsequent periods:Scienceas ahalf-way house,at which the mediocre, more multifarious, and more complicated beings
find their most natural gratification and means of expression: all
those who do well to avoidaction.598.A. philosopher recuperates his strength in a way quite his own, and
with other means: he does it, for instance, with Nihilism. The beliefthat there is no such thing as truth,the Nihilistic belief, is a
tremendous relaxation for one who, asa warrior of knowledge, is
unremittingly struggling with a host of hateful truths. For truth is
ugly.599.The "purposelessness of all phenomena": the belief in this is the
result of the view that all interpretations hitherto have been false,
it is a generalisation on the part of discouragement and weakness—it
is not a necessary belief.The arrogance of man: when he sees no purpose, hedeniesthat there
can be one!600.The unlimited ways of interpreting the world: every interpretation is a
symptom of growth or decline.Unity (monism) is a need of inertia; Plurality in interpretation is a
sign of strength. One should notdesire to deprivethe world of its
disquieting and enigmatical nature.601.Against the desire for reconciliation and peaceableness. To this also
belongs every attempt on the part of monism.602.This relative world, this world for the eye, the touch, and the
ear, is very false, even when adjusted to a much more sensitive
sensualapparatus. But its comprehensibility, its clearness, its
practicability, its beauty, will begin tonear their endif werefineour senses, just as beauty ceases to exist when the processes
of its history are reflected upon: the arrangement of theendis in
itself an illusion. Let it suffice, that the more coarsely and more
superficially it is understood, themore valuable,the more definite,
the more beautiful and important the world then seems. The more
deeply one looks into it, the further our valuation retreats from our
view,-senselessness approaches!We have created the world that has
any value! Knowing this, we also perceive that the veneration of truth
is already theresult of illusion—and that it is much more necessary
to esteem the formative, simplifying, moulding, and romancing power."All is false—everything is allowed!"Only as the result of a certain bluntness of vision and the desire for
simplicity does the beautiful and the "valuable" make its appearance:
in itself it is purely fanciful.603.We know that the destruction of an illusion does not necessarily
produce a truth, but only one more piece ofignorance;it is the
extension of our "empty space," an increase in our "waste."604.Of what alone canknowledgeconsist?—"Interpretation," the
introduction of a sense intothings,not"explanation" (in the
majority of cases a new interpretation of an old interpretation which
has grown incomprehensible and little more than a mere sign). There
is no such thing as an established fact, everything fluctuates,
everything, is intangible, yielding; after all, the most lasting of all
things are our opinions.605.The ascertaining of "truth" and "untruth," the ascertaining of facts
in general, is fundamentally different from the creativeplacing,forming, moulding, subduing, andwillingwhich lies at the root ofphilosophy. To give a sense to things—this duty always remainsover,providedno sense already lies in them.The same holds good
of sounds, and also of the fate of nations they are susceptible of the
most varied interpretations and turns,for different purposes.A higher duty is tofix a goaland to mould facts according to
it:that is,theinterpretation of action,and not merely atransvaluationof concepts.606.Man ultimately finds nothing more in things than he himself has laid
in them—this process of finding again is science, the actual process
of laying a meaning in things, is art, religion, love, pride. In both,
even if they are child's play, one should show good courage and one
should plough ahead; on the one hand, to find again, on the other,—we
are the other,—to lay a sense in things.607.Science: its two sides:—In regard to the individual;In regard to the complex of culture ("levels of culture")—antagonistic valuation in regard to this and that side.608.The development of science tends ever more to transform the known into
the unknown: its aim, however, is to do thereverse,and it starts
out with the instinct of tracing the unknown to the known.In short, science is laying the road tosovereign ignorance,to a
feeling that "knowledge" does not exist at all, that it was merely a
form of haughtiness to dream of such a thing; further, that we have not
preserved the smallest notion which would allow us to class knowledge
even as apossibilitythat "knowledge" is a contradictory idea. Wetransfera primeval myth and piece of human vanity into the land
of hard facts: we canallowa thing-in-itself as a concept, just
as little as we canallow"knowledge-in-itself." Themisleadinginfluence of "numbers and logic," the misleading influence of "laws."Wisdomis an attempt toovercomethe perspective valuations (i.e.the "will to power"): it is a principle which is both unfriendly to
Life, and also decadent; a symptom in the case of the Indians, etc.;weaknessof the power of appropriation.609.It does not suffice for you to see in what ignorance man and beast now
live; you must also have and learn thedesireforignorance.It
is necessary that you should know that without this form of ignorance
life itself would be impossible, that it is merely a vital condition
under which, alone, a living organism can preserve itself and prosper:
a great solid belt of ignorance must stand about you.610.Science—the transformation of Nature into concepts for the purpose of
governing Nature—that is part of the rubricmeans.But thepurposeandwillof mankind must grow in the same way, the
intention in regard to the whole.611.Thoughtis the strongest and most persistently exercised function in
all stages of life—and also in every act of perception or apparent
experience! Obviously it soon becomes themightiestandmost
exactingof all functions, and in time tyrannises over other powers.
Ultimately it becomes "passion in itself."612.The right to great passion must be reclaimed for the investigator,
after self-effacement and the cult of "objectivity" have created a
false order of rank in this sphere. Error reached its zenithwhen
Schopenhauer taught:in the release from passion andin will alone
lay the road to "truth," to knowledge; the intellect freed from willcould not helpseeing the true and actual essence of things. The same
error in art: as if everything becamebeautifulthe moment it was
regarded without will.613.The contest for supremacy among the passions, and the dominion of one
of the passions over the intellect.614.To "humanise" the world means to feel ourselves ever more and more
masters upon earth.615.Knowledge, among a higher class of beings, will also take new forms
which are not yet necessary.616.That theworth of the worldlies in our interpretations (that perhaps
yet other interpretations are possible somewhere, besides mankind's);
that the interpretations made hitherto were perspective valuations,
by means of which we were able to survive in life,i.e.in the
Will to Power and in the growth of power; that everyelevation of
maninvolves the overcoming of narrower interpretations; that every
higher degree of strength or power attained, brings new views in its
train, and teaches a belief in new horizons—these doctrines liescattered through all my works. The world thatconcerns us at allis
false—that is to say, is not a fact; but a romance, a piece of human
sculpture, made from a meagre sum of observation; it is "in flux"; it
is something that evolves, a great revolving lie continually moving
onwards and never getting any nearer to truth—for there is no such
thing as "truth."617.Recapitulation:—TostampBecoming with the character of Being—this is the highestWill to Power.The twofold falsification,by the senses on the one hand, by the
intellect on the other, with the view of maintaining a world of being,
of rest, of equivalent cases, etc.Thateverything recurs,is the very nearestapproach of a world of
Becoming to a world of Being, the height of contemplation.It is out of the values which have been attributed to Being, that the
condemnation of, and dissatisfaction with, Becoming, have sprung: once
such a world of Being had been invented.The metamorphoses of Being (body, God, ideas, natural laws, formulæ,
etc.)."Being" as appearance the twisting round of values: appearance was that
whichconferred the values.Knowledge in itself in a world of Becoming is impossible; how can
knowledge be possible at all, then? Only as a mistaking of one's self,
as will to power, as will to deception.Becoming is inventing, willing, self-denying, self-overcoming; no
subject but an action, it places things, it is creative, no "causes and
effects."Art is the will to overcome Becoming, it is a process of eternalising,
but short-sighted, always according to the perspective, repeating, as
it were in a small way, the tendency of the whole.That whichall lifeshows, is to be regarded as a reduced formula for
the collective tendency: hence the new definition of the concept "Life"
as "will to power."Instead of "cause and effect," the struggle of evolving factors with
one another, frequently with the result that the opponent is absorbed;
no constant number for Becoming.The uselessness of old ideals for the interpretation of all that takes
place, once their bestial origin and utility have been recognised, they
are, moreover, all hostile to life.The uselessness of the mechanical theory—it gives the impression that
therecan be no purpose.All theidealismof mankind, hitherto, is on the point of
turning intoNihilism—may be shown to be a belief in absoluteworthlessness,i.e. purposelessness.The annihilation of ideals, the new desert waste the new arts which
will help us to endure it—amphibiathat we are!First principles,bravery, patience, no "stepping-back," not too much
ardour to get to the fore. (N.B.—Zarathustra constantly maintaining
an attitude of parody towards all former values, as the result of his
overflowing energy.)II.THE WILL TO POWER IN NATURE.1. The Mechanical Interpretation of the World.618.Of all the interpretations of the world attempted heretofore, themechanicalone seems to-day to stand most prominently in the front.
Apparently it has a clean conscience on its side; for no science
believes inwardly in progress and success unless it be with the help
of mechanical procedures. Every one knows these procedures: "reason"
and "purpose" are allowed to remain out of consideration as far as
possible; it is shown that, provided a sufficient amount of time be
allowed to elapse, everything can evolve out of everything else, and no
one attempts to suppress his malicious satisfaction, when the "apparent
design in the fate" of a plant or of the yolk of an egg, may be traced
to stress and thrust in short, people are heartily glad to pay respect
to this principle of profoundest stupidity, if I may be allowed to pass
a playful remark concerning these serious matters. Meanwhile, among the
most select intellects to be found in this movement,some presentiment
of evil, some anxiety is noticeable, as if the theory had a rent in it,
which sooner or later might be its last: I mean the sort of rent which
denotes the end of all balloons inflated with such theories.Stress and thrust themselves cannot be "explained," one cannot get rid
of theactio in distans.The belief even in the ability to explain is
now lost, and people peevishly admit that one can only describe, not
explain that the dynamic interpretation of the world, with its denial
of "empty space" and its little agglomerations of atoms, will soon get
the better of physicists: although in this wayDynamisis certainly
granted an inner quality.619.The triumphant concept "energy" with which our physicists created
God and the world, needs yet to be completed: it must be given an
inner will which I characterise as the "Will to Power"—that is to
say, as an insatiable desire to manifest power; or the application and
exercise of power as a creative instinct, etc. Physicists cannot get
rid of the "actio in distans" in their principles; any more than they
can a repelling force (or an attracting one). There is no help for it,
all movements, all "appearances," all "laws" must be understood assymptomsof aninnerphenomenon, and the analogy of man must be
used for this purpose. It is possible to trace all the instincts of an
animal to the will to power; as also all the functions of organic life
to this one source.620.Has anybody ever been able to testify to aforce!No, but toeffects,translated into a completely strange language. Regularity in
sequence has so spoilt us,that we no longer wonder at the wonderful
process.621.A force of which we cannot form any idea, is an empty word, and ought
to have no civic rights in the city of science: and the same applies to
the purely mechanical powers of attracting and repelling by means of
which we can form an image of the world—no more!622.Squeezes and kicksare something incalculably recent, evolved and
not primeval. They presuppose something which holds together andcanpress and strike! But how could it hold together?623.There is nothingunalterablein chemistry: this is only appearance,
a mere school prejudice. We it was whointroducedthe unalterable,
taking it from metaphysics as usual, Mr. Chemist. It is a mere
superficial judgment to declare that the diamond, graphite, and carbon
are identical. Why? Simply because no loss of substance can be traced
in the scales! Well then, at least they have something in common; but
the work of the molecules in theprocess of changing from one form to
the other, an action we can neither see nor weigh, is just exactly what
makes one material something different—with specifically different
qualities.624.Againstthe physicalatom.—In order to understand the world, we
must be able to reckon it up; in order to be able to reckon it up, we
must be aware of constant causes; but since we find no such constant
causes in reality, weinventthem for ourselves and call them atoms.
This is the origin of the atomic theory.The possibility of calculating the world, the possibility of expressing
all phenomena by means of formulæ—is that really "understanding"? What
would be understood of a piece of music, if all that were calculable in
it and capable of being expressed in formulas, were reckoned up?—Thus
"constant causes", things, substances, something "unconditioned," were
thereforeinvented;—what has been attained thereby?625.The mechanical concept of "movement" is already a translation of the
original process into thelanguage of symbols of the eye and the
touch.The conceptatom,the distinction between the "seat of a motive force
and the force itself," is alanguage of symbols derived from our
logical and physical world.It does not lie within our power to alter ourmeans of expression:
it is possible to understand to what extend they are but symptomatic.
To demand anadequate means of expression is nonsense: it lies at
the heart of a language, of a medium of communication, to expressrelationonly.... The concept "truth" isopposed to good sense.The whole province of truth—falsenessonly applies to the relations
between beings, not to an "absolute." There is no such thing as a
"being in itself" (relationsin the first place constitute being),
any more than there can be "knowledge in itself."626."The feeling of forcecannot proceed from movement: feeling in
general cannot proceed from movement.""Even in support of this, an apparent experience is the only evidence:
in a substance (brain) feeling is generated through transmitted motion
(stimuli). But generated? Would this show that the feeling didnotyet exist thereat all? so that its appearance wouldhaveto
be regarded as thecreative actof the intermediary—motion? The
feelingless condition of this substance is only an hypothesis! not an
experience! Feeling, therefore is thequalityof the substance: there
actually are substances that feel.""Do we learn from certain substances that they havenofeeling? No,
we merely cannot tell that they have any. It is impossible to seek the
origin of feeling in non-sensitive substance."—Oh what hastiness!627."To attract" and "to repel", in a purely mechanical sense, is pure
fiction: a word. We cannot imagine an attraction without apurpose.—Either the will to possess one's self of a thing, or the will to defend
one's self from a thing or to repel it—thatwe "understand"; that
would be an interpretation which we could use.In short, the psychological necessity of believing in causality lies in
theimpossibility of imagining a process without a purpose: but of
course this says nothing concerning truth or untruth (the justification
of such a belief)! The belief incausæcollapses with the belief in
τέλει (against Spinoza and his causationism).628.It is an illusion to suppose that something isknown,when all
we have is a mathematical formula of what has happened; it is onlycharacterised, described;no more!629.If I bring a regularly recurring phenomenon into a formula, I have
facilitated and shortened my task of characterising the whole
phenomenon, etc. But I have not thereby ascertained a "law," I have
only replied to the question: How is it that something recurs here? It
is a supposition that the formula corresponds to a complex of really
unknown forces and the discharge of forces; it ispure mythology to
suppose that forces here obey a law, so that, as the result of their
obedience, we have the same phenomenon every time.630.I take good care not to speak of chemical "laws": to do so savours of
morality. It is much more a question of establishing certain relations
of power: the stronger becomes master of the weaker, in so far as the
latter cannot maintain its degree of independence,—here there is no
pity, no quarter, and, still less, any observance of "law."631.The unalterable sequence of certain phenomena does not prove any "law,"
but a relation of power between two or more forces. To say, "But it
is precisely this relation that remains the same!" is no better than
saying, "One and the same force cannot be another force."—It is not a
matter ofsequence,but a matter ofinterdependence,a process in
which the procession of moments donotdetermine each other after the
manner of cause and effect....The separation of the "action" from the "agent"; of the phenomenon from
theworkerof that phenomenon: of the process from one that is not
process, but lasting,substance,thing, body, soul, etc.; the attempt
to understand a life as a sort of shifting of things and a changing of
places; of a sort of "being" or stable entity: this ancient mythologyestablished the belief in "cause and effect," once it had found a
lasting form in the functions of speech and grammar.632.The "regularity" of a sequence is only a metaphorical expression, not
a fact, justas ifa rule were followed here! And the same holds
good of "conformity to law." We find a formula in order to express an
ever-recurring kind of succession of phenomena: but that does not show
that we havediscovered a law; much less a force which is the cause
of a recurrence of effects. The fact that something always happens
thus or thus, is interpreted here as if a creature always acted thus
or thus as the result of obedience to a law or to a lawgiver: whereas
apart from the "law" it would be free to act differently. But precisely
that inability to act otherwise might originate in the creature itself,
it might be that it did not act thus or thus in response to a law,
but simply because it was so constituted. It would mean simply: that
something cannot also be something else; that it cannot be first this,
and then something quite different; that it is neither free nor the
reverse, but merely thus or thus.The fault lies in thinking a subject
into things.633.To speak of two consecutive states, the first as "cause," and the
second as "effect," is false. The first state cannot bring about
anything, the second has nothing effected in it.It is a question of a struggle between two elements unequal in power:
a new adjustment is arrived at, according to the measure of power each
possesses. The second state is something fundamentally different from
the first (it is not its effect): the essential thing Is, that the
factors which engage in the struggle leave it with different quanta of
power.634.A. criticism of Materialism.—Let us dismiss the two popular
concepts, Necessity and Law, from this idea: the first introduces a
false constraint, the second a false liberty into the world. "Things"
do not act regularly, they follow norule:there are no things (that
is our fiction); neither do they act in accordance with any necessity.
There is no obedience here: for, the fact thatsomething isas it is,
strong or weak, is not the result of obedience or of a rule or of a
constraint....The degree of resistance and the degree of superior power—this is the
question around which all phenomena turn: if we, for our own purposes
and calculations, know how to express this in formulas and "laws," all
the better for us! But that does not mean that we have introduced any
"morality" into the world, just because we have fancied it as obedient.There are no laws: every power draws its last consequence at every
moment. Things are calculable precisely owing to the fact that there is
no possibility of their being otherwise than they are.A quantum of power is characterised by theeffect it produces
and the influence it resists. The adiaphoric state which would be
thinkable in itself, is entirely lacking. It is essentially a will to
violence and a will to defend one's self against violence. It is not
self-preservation: every atom exercises its influence over the whole of
existence—it is thought out of existence if one thinks this radiation
of will-power away. That is why I call it a quantum of "Will to
Power"; with this formula one can express the character which cannot
be abstracted in thought from mechanical order, without suppressing the
latter itself in thought.The translation of the world of effect into avisibleworld—a world
for the eye—is the concept "movement." Here it is always understood
thatsomethinghas been moved,—whether it be the fiction of an
atomic globule or even of the abstraction of the latter, the dynamic
atom, something is always imagined that has an effect—that is to say,
we have not yet rid ourselves of the habit into which our senses and
speech inveigled us. Subject and object, an agent to the action, the
action and that which does it separated: we must not forget that all
this signifies no more than semeiotics and—nothing real. Mechanics as
a teaching ofmovementis already a translation of phenomena into
man's language of the senses.635.We are in need of "unities" in order to be able to reckon: but this is
no reason for supposing that "unities" actuallyexist.We borrowed
theconcept "unity" from our concept "ego,"—our very oldest article
of faith. If we did not believe ourselves to be unities we should never
have formed the concept "thing." Now—that is to say, somewhat late in
the day, we are overwhelmingly convinced that our conception of the
concept "ego" is no security whatever for a real entity. In order to
maintain the mechanical interpretation of the world theoretically, we
must always make the reserve that it is with fictions that we do so:
the concept ofmovement(derived from the language of our senses)
and the concept of theatom(= entity, derived from our psychical
experience) are based upon asense-prejudiceand apsychological
prejudice.Mechanics formulates consecutive phenomena, and it does so
semeiologically, in the terms of the senses and of the mind (that all
influence ismovement; that where there is movement something is at
work moving): it does not touch the question of the causal force.Themechanicalworld is imagined as the eye and the sense of touch
alone could imagine a world (as "moved"),—in such a way as to be
calculable,—as to simulate causal entities "things" (atoms) whose
effect is constant (the transfer of the false concept of subject to the
concept atom).The mixing together of the concept of numbers, of the concept of thing
(the idea of subject), of the concept of activity (the separation of
that which is the cause, and the effect), of the concept of movement:
all these things are phenomenal; our eye and ourpsychologyare still
in it all.If we eliminate these adjuncts, nothing remainsover but dynamic
quanta, in a relation of tension to all other dynamic quanta: the
essence of which resides in their relation to all other quanta, in
their "influence" upon the latter. The will to power, not Being, not
Becoming, but apathos—is the elementary fact, from these first
results a Becoming, an influencing....636.The physicists believe in a "true world" after their own kind; a
fixedsystematising of atomsto perform necessary movements, and
holding good equally of all creatures, so that, according to them,
the "world of appearance" reduces itself to the side of general and
generally-needed Being, which is accessible to every one according to
his kind (accessible and also adjusted,—made "subjective"). But here
they are in error. The atom which they postulate is arrived at by the
logic of that perspective of consciousness; it is in itself therefore
a subjective fiction. This picture of the world which they project
is in no way essentially different from the subjective picture: the
only difference is, that it is composed simply with more extended
senses, but certainly withoursenses.... And in the end, without
knowing it, they left something out of the constellation: precisely
the necessaryperspective factor,by means of which every centre of
power—and not man alone—constructs the rest of the worldfrom its
point of view—that is to say, measures it, feels it, and moulds it
according to its degree of strength.... They forgot to reckon with
this perspective-fixing power,in "true being,"—or, in school-terms,
subject-being. They suppose that this was "evolved" and added;—but
even the chemical investigator needs it: it is indeedspecific Being,which determines action and reaction according to circumstances.Perspectivity is only a complex form, of specificness.My idea is
that every specific body strives to become master of all space, and to
extend its power (its will to power), and to thrust back everything
that resists it. But inasmuch as it is continually meeting the same
endeavours on the part of other bodies, it concludes by coming to terms
with those (by "combining" with those) which are sufficiently related
to it—and thus they conspire together for power.And the process
continues.637.Even in the inorganic world all that concerns an atom of energy is its
immediate neighbourhood: distant forces balance each other. Here is
the root ofperspectivity,and it explains why a living organism is
"egoistic" to the core.638.Granting that the world disposed of a quantum of force, it is obvious
that any transposition of force to any place would affect the whole
system—thus, besides the causality ofsequence,there would also be
a dependence,contiguity,andcoincidence.639.The only possible way of upholding the sense of the concept "God" would
be: to makeHim notthe motive force, but the condition ofmaximum
power,anepoch;a point in the further development of theWill to
Power;by means of which subsequent evolution just as much as former
evolution—up to Him—could be explained.Viewed mechanically, the energy of collective Becoming remains
constant; regarded from the economical standpoint, it ascends
to its zenith and then recedes therefrom in order to remain
eternally rotatory. This "Will to Power" expresses itself in theinterpretation in the manner in which the strength is used.—The
conversion of energy into life; "life in its highest power"
thenceforward appears as the goal. The same amount of energy, at
different stages of development, means different things.That which determines growth in Life is the economy which becomes ever
more sparing and methodical, which achieves ever more and more with a
steadily decreasing amount of energy.... The ideal is the principle of
the least possible expense....The only thingthat is provedis that the world isnotstriving
towards a state of stability. Consequently its zenith must not be
conceived as a state of absolute equilibrium....The dire necessity of the same things happening in the course of the
world, as in all other things, is not an eternal determinism reigning
over all phenomena, but merely the expression of the factthat the
impossible is not possible; that a given force cannot be different
from that given force; that a given quantity of resisting force does
not manifest itself otherwise than in conformity with its degree of
strength;—to speak of events as being necessary is tautological.2. The Will to Power as Life.(a) The Organic Process.640.Man imagines that he was present at the generation of the organic
world: what was there to be observed, with the eyes and the touch,
in regard to these processes? How much of it can be put into round
numbers? What rules are noticeable in the movements? Thus, man would
fain arrange all phenomena as if they werefor the eye and for the
touch,as if they were forms of motion: he will discoverformuleswherewith tosimplifythe unwieldy mass of these experiences.The reduction of all phenomenato the level of men with senses and
with mathematics. It is a matter of makingan inventory of human
experiences:granting that man, or rather thehuman eye and the
ability to form concepts,have been the eternal witnesses of all
things.641.A plurality of forces bound by a common nutritive process we call
"Life." To this nutritiveprocess all so-called feeling, thinking,
and imagining belong as means—that is to say, (1) in the form of
opposing other forces; (2) in the form of an adjustment of other forces
according to mould and rhythm; (3) the form of a valuation relative to
assimilation and excretion.642.The bond between the inorganic and the organic world must lie in the
repelling power exercised by every atom of energy. "Life" might be
defined as a lasting form offorce-establishing processes,in which
the various contending forces, on their part, grow unequally. To what
extent does counter-strife exist even in obedience? Individual power is
by no means surrendered through it. In the same way, there exists in
the act of commanding, an acknowledgment of the fact that the absolute
power of the adversary has not been overcome, absorbed, or dissipated.
"Obedience," and "command," are forms of the game of war.643.The Will to Powerinterprets(an organ in the process of formation
has to be interpreted): it defines, it determines gradations,
differences of power. Mere differences of power could not be aware of
each other as such: something must be there whichwillgrow, and
which interprets all other things that would do the same, according to
the value of the latter. In sooth, all interpretationis but a means
in itself to become master of something. (Continualinterpretationis
the first principle of the organic process.)644.Greater complexity, sharp differentiation, the contiguity of the
developed organs and functions, with the disappearance of intermediate
members—ifthatisperfection,then there is a Will to Power
apparent in the organic process by means of whosedominating,
shaping,andcommandingforces it is continually increasing the
sphere of its power, and persistently simplifying things within that
sphere, itgrowsimperatively."Spirit" is only a means and an instrument in the service of higher
life, in the service of the elevation of life.645."Heredity," as something quite incomprehensible, cannot be used
as an explanation, but only as a designation for the identification
of a problem. And the same holds good of "adaptability." As a
matter of fact, the account of morphology, even supposing it were
perfect,explainsnothing, it merely describes an enormous fact.Howa given organ gets to be used for any particular purpose is not
explained. There is just as little explained in regard to these things
by the assumption ofcausæ finalesas by the assumption ofcausæ
efficientes.The concept "causa" is only a means of expression, nomore; a means of designating a thing.646.They are analogies; for instance, ourmemorymay suggest another kind
of memory which makes itself felt in heredity, development, and forms.
Ourinventiveand experimentative powers suggest another kind of
inventiveness in the application of instruments to new ends, etc.That which we call our "consciousness" is quite guiltless of any
of the essential processes of our preservation and growth; and no
human brain could be so subtle as to construct anything more than a
machine—to which every organic process is infinitely superior.647.Against Darwinism.—The use of an organ doesnotexplain its
origin, on the contrary! During the greater part of the time occupied
in the formation of a certain quality, this quality does not help to
preserve the individual; it is of no use to him, and particularly not
in his struggle with external circumstances and foes.What is ultimately "useful"? It is necessary to ask, "Useful for what"?For instance, that which promotes thelasting powersof the
individual might be unfavourable to his strength or his beauty; that
which preserves him might at the same time fix him and keep him stable
throughout development. On the other hand, adeficiency,a state ofdegeneration,may be of the greatest possible use, inasmuch as it
acts as a stimulus to other organs. In the same way,astate of needmay be a condition of existence, inasmuch as it reduces an individual
to that modicum of means which, though itkeeps him together,does
not allow him to squander his strength.—The individual himself is
the struggle of parts (for nourishment, space, etc.): his development
involves thetriumph,thepredominance,of isolated parts; thewasting away,or the "development into organs," of other parts.The influence of "environment" is nonsensicallyoverratedin Darwin,
the essential factor in the process of life is precisely the tremendous
inner power to shape and to create forms, which merelyuses, exploits"environment."The new forms built up by this inner power are not produced with a view
to any end; but, in the struggle between the parts, a new form does not
exist longwithoutbecoming related to some kind of semi-utility,
and, according to its use, develops itself ever more and more perfectly.648."Utility" in respect of the acceleration of the speed of evolution, is
a different kind of "utility" from that which is understood to mean the
greatest possible stability and staying power of the evolved creature.649."Useful" in the sense of Darwinian biology means: that which favours a
thing in its struggle with others. But in my opinion thefeeling ofbeing surcharged,the feeling accompanying anincrease in strength,quite apart from the utility of the struggle, is the actualprogress:
from these feelings the will to war is first derived.650.Physiologists should bethink themselves before putting down the
instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic
being. A living thing seeks above all todischargeits strength:
"self-preservation"is only one of the results thereof.—Let us
beware ofsuperfluousteleological principles!—one of which is the
whole concept of "self-preservation."[4]
